    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">General Information</span></b>
    <hr>
      One of the most common complication of a sexually
      transmitted disease (STD), second only to AIDS, is PID.<a href="pid___ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=
    ""><sup>[1]</sup></a> <SPAN
      class=smalldict>PID</span> is an infection of the reproductive organs (the
      fallopian tubes, uterus, ovaries, and other related structures). It
      usually begins with an infection of the cervix, caused by <SPAN
      class=smalldict>GONORRHEA</span> and genital chlamydial infections, two
      common STD's. If the infection of the <SPAN class=smalldict>CERVIX</span>
      is not treated with antibiotics, the bacteria can migrate upward from the
      <SPAN class=smalldict>CERVIX</span> into the upper genital tract. This can
      then spread the infection to the endometrium and to the fallopian tubes,
      uterus, ovaries, and abdomen. You can become infertile as a result of PID.
      In fact, more than 100,000 women experience infertility each year as a
      consequence of <SPAN class=smalldict>PID</span> <a href="pid___ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=
    ""><sup>[2]</sup></a>.

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Symptoms</span></b>
    <hr>

       Major symptoms of <SPAN class=smalldict>PID</span> include:
      <UL>
        <LI>lower abdominal pain and/or lower back pain </li>
        <LI>longer and/or heavier menstrual periods </li>
        <LI>cramps or spotting throughout the month </li>
        <LI>unusual vaginal discharge (change in smell, color, or amount) </li>
        <LI>drowsiness </li>
        <LI>weakness </li>
        <LI>nausea and vomiting </li>
        <LI>pain during intercourse </li>
        <LI>pain or burning sensation during urination </li>
        <LI>pain or belly tenderness when your health care provider moves your
        <SPAN class=smalldict>CERVIX</span> or examines your ovaries. </li></ul>As
      soon as you notice symptoms, make sure you see your health care provider
      immediately. Although college work can be intense and take up a lot of
      time, ignoring these symptoms will only make future treatment more
      difficult and increase your chances of becoming infertile.

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Diagnosis</span></b>
    <hr>
      To diagnose PID, your doctor will perform a physical exam to determine
      the nature and location of the pain. He/she will probably check you for
      fever, abnormal vaginal or cervical discharge, abdominal pain, and
      evidence of cervical chlamydial infection or gonorrhea. If more
      information is needed, your doctor may order other tests, such as a
      sonogram, endometrial biopsy, or <SPAN class=smalldict>LAPAROSCOPY</span>
      to distinguish between <SPAN class=smalldict>PID</span> and other serious
      problems that may mimic PID.
      <P>Depending on how sick you are, you may be treated either in a hospital
      or as an outpatient. If you are treated as an outpatient, you will receive
      antibiotics and must follow your health care provider's directions on
      taking them. You need to take all of the pills even if the symptoms are no
      longer present. A few days after you start taking medicine, you will need
      to see your health care provider again. It is important to stay in bed and
      get lots of rest, focusing on your health needs. As a hospital patient you
      will receive intravenous (IV) and oral antibiotics until the symptoms get
      better. After leaving the hospital, you will have to take oral antibiotics
      for another 2 weeks. Although you may feel better quickly, the infection
      can remain in your system and recur. In order to get better, you need to
      follow your doctor's instructions. </p>
      <P>PID can be dangerous if not treated early; scar tissue can form in the
      fallopian tubes and inside the abdomen. These scars can block the
      fallopian tubes, which can cause infertility or difficulties in getting
      pregnant. If the tubes are partly blocked, fertilized eggs may not reach
      the uterus and a pregnancy can form in the fallopian tubes, known as a
      tubal or <SPAN class=smalldict>ECTOPIC</span> pregnancy. If the effects of
      <SPAN class=smalldict>PID</span> are very severe, surgery may be needed to
      remove pus, scar tissue, or damaged organs. </p>

    <hr>

      <UL>
        <LI>The safest way to avoid <SPAN class=smalldict>PID</span> is to
        remain abstinent from sex. </li>
        <LI>If you are sexually active, use a latex condom correctly all the
        time to prevent the spread of STDs </li>
        <LI>Do not use douches-they have been known to spread the bacteria
        further up the vagina </li>
        <LI>Avoid nicotine and alcohol </li>
        <LI>Observe changes in your body, such as abnormal discharge or bleeding </li>

        <LI>Finish all prescribed antibiotics if being treated for PID, and make
        sure your partner(s) gets treated if they have an STD. </li>
        <LI>Limit the number of sexual partners you have since that increases
        your risks of getting an STD and consequently PID. </li></ul>
