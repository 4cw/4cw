    <hr>

      <P><A name=general></A>Uterine leiomyomas, commonly known as fibroids, are
      rounded, benign tumors arising from the smooth muscle layer of the uterus.
      Other names for these tumors include fibromyomas, fibromas, myofibromas,
      and myomas. It is estimated that between 20 and 30% of women of
      reproductive age have fibroids, though not all cases have been diagnosed
      (1). These benign tumors may cause no symptoms, and may never need
      treatment. Unfortunately for many women, fibroids -depending on their
      location- can cause a range of problems from pain, to abnormal bleeding,
      to infertility. Why fibroids develops a mystery, although some studies
      indicate a genetic component. </p>
      <P>Fibroids are usually detected in women in their 30's and 40's and
      shrink after <SPAN class=smalldict>MENOPAUSE</SPAN> (in the absence of
      post-menopausal estrogen replacement therapy). However, this does not
      imply that college women are not at risk, but rather that they are less
      likely to develop these fibroids. Risk for developing fibroids is also
      higher in women who are heavy for their height and is lower in women who
      are smokers and in women who have given birth (2). However, it is
      important to note that the health risks posed by smoking are great.

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Symptoms</span></b>
    <hr>

      <p>The two most common symptoms of fibroids are abnormal uterine bleeding,
      known as menorrhagia, and pelvic pressure. Normal menstrual periods
      typically last four to five days, whereas women with fibroids often have
      periods lasting longer than their menstrual cycle. The heavy bleeding
      requires that women change sanitary protection frequently (as often as
      every hour). However, bleeding between periods is unusual and should be
      immediately reported to the physician for it may very well serve as a
      symptom for a different reproductive disorder. </p>
      <P>Pelvic pressure can result from an increase in the size of the uterus
      or from a particular fibroid. Most women with fibroids have an enlarged
      uterus. It is not unusual for a uterus with fibroids to reach the size of
      a four to five month pregnancy. Since the fibroid uterus has an irregular
      shape and form, women can experience an unusual pressure in the uterus
      region in addition to pressure on specific adjacent pelvic structures
      including the bowel and/or bladder. Pressure on these structures can
      result in difficulty with bowel movements and constipation or urinary
      frequency and incontinence. </p>
      <P>Fibroids are also associated with a range of reproductive problems
      since they are most often responsible for physically distorting the
      uterus. These include recurrent miscarriage, infertility, premature labor,
      and complications of labor. <a href="fibroids___ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">How do I know if I have Fibroids?</span></b>
    <hr>

       The diagnosis of fibroids is usually easily determined by a bimanual
      clinical exam where your gynecologist performs pelvic examination. This
      procedure allows your physician to evaluate the size and shape of the
      uterus and surrounding pelvic structures by inserting two fingers of one
      hand into the vagina while feeling your abdomen above the pubic bone with
      the other hand.
      <P>In addition, imaging studies such as ultrasonography, <SPAN
      class=smalldict>MRI</SPAN> (magnetic resonance imagery), and CT (computed
      tomography) may be useful in confirming the diagnosis. </p>
      <P>In women experiencing heavy bleeding (menorrhagia) or recurrent
      pregnancy losses, assessment of the uterine cavity is important because
      the presence of a submucous fibroid can be missed on traditional
      ultrasound. <SPAN class=smalldict>HYSTEROSALPINGOGRAPHY</SPAN> and
      sonohysterography, use X-ray pictures and ultrasound pictures,
      respectively, to visualize the uterine cavity after a specific dye is
      injected into the uterus. Hysteroscopy allows direct visualization of the
      uterine cavity by inserting a small camera on the end of a long tube
      directly into the uterus through the vagina and cervix. <SPAN
      class=smalldict>LAPAROSCOPY</SPAN> allows direct visualization of the
      outside of the uterus and the surrounding pelvic structures by introducing
      a small camera on the end of a tube directly into the abdominal cavity
      through an incision in the umbilicus. <a href="fibroids___ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Treatment</span></b>
    <hr>

       Methods of treatment depend on the severity of symptoms, age, pregnancy
      status, desire for future pregnancies, general health, and characteristics
      of the fibroid(s). Treatment may consist of simply monitoring the
      fibroids, specifically their rate of growth, with periodic pelvic exams or
      ultrasound. This method is usually sufficient in pre-menopausal women.
      <P><B>Hormonal treatment</B><BR>This treatment involves drugs such as
      Nafarelin and Leuporlide, causes fibroids to shrink. This method is
      sometimes used in pre-menopausal women who want to get pregnant, but have
      problems conceiving because of the tumors. If fibroids become large
      enough, they may block the fallopian tubes or fill the uterine cavity. The
      hormones produce an environment in the body that is very similar to that
      of menopause, called pseudo-menopause. The treatment spans over several
      months and during this time the reduction in estrogen concentration allows
      the fibroids to shrink. Since fibroids will begin to enlarge as soon as
      treatment stops, the woman is encouraged to begin attempting to conceive
      almost immediately. </p>
      <P>For women who do not want to conceive, but also don't want to undergo
      surgery, hormone treatment is frequently an option. The side effects of
      this type of treatment usually include menopausal symptoms. If treatment
      is discontinued, fibroids will re-grow. </p>
      <P><B>Myomectomy</B><BR>A myomectomy, which is a surgical procedure to
      remove just the fibroids, is frequently the chosen treatment, especially
      for pre-menopausal women who want to bear more children. Another advantage
      of a <SPAN class=smalldict>MYOMECTOMY</SPAN> is that it controls pain or
      excessive bleeding that some women with uterine fibroids experience. This
      may leave the uterine walls weakened causing most babies from future
      pregnancies to be delivered by caesarean section (4). </p>
      <P><B>Hysterectomy</B><BR>A total hysterectomy, which involves removal of
      the uterus, is another option. In past years this has been the most common
      option for the removal of fibroids, physicians are turning to the less
      invasive procedures discussed above to deal with fibroids.
