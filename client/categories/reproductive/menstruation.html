      <p>Getting your period is not only an indication that a girl
      is entering womanhood, but it is also a physiological
      indication that your body is capable of having a baby.&nbsp;
      From the moment a girl gets her first period, usually around
      age 13, but sometimes as early as age 8 and as late as age
      19, she will experience many physical as well as emotional
      changes.&nbsp; At first these changes might not be so
      comfortable or even welcomed, but whether we like it or not,
      they're here to stay for a while, so let's make
      the best of it!</p>

      <p>The first step is getting to know your body and
      understanding what is happening during your menstrual
      cycle:</p>

      <p>Your period is usually on a cycle of 28 days, though
      different women's cycles vary by a few days.&nbsp; The
      day you start bleeding is considered the first day of your
      cycle, meaning that 28 days or so from then you will bleed
      again and then your cycle will start all over.&nbsp; In other
      words, from the first day of one period until the first day
      of the next is your <u>menstrual cycle</u>.&nbsp; You will
      have your menstrual cycle until you begin menopause.</p>

      <b>What Happens During My Period?</b><sup><a href="menstruation___ftn1"
       name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></sup><hr>

      <p>A woman's reproductive system is largely controlled
      by two powerful hormones -- estrogen and
      progesterone.&nbsp; Women have two ovaries that store
      thousands of microscopic eggs.&nbsp; Girls are born with all
      the eggs they will ever have, but these eggs do not fully
      mature until they are ready to be released from an
      ovary.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Preparation for release of an egg from an ovary is
      triggered by production of high levels of these two hormones
      by the ovaries.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>These hormones trigger certain changes in the endometrium,
      the lining of the uterus.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>In preparation for releasing an egg, the lining of the
      uterus begins to thicken and build up a blood-rich lining for
      a possible pregnancy.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Estrogen then stimulates the ovaries to release a ripe
      egg, also referred to as ovum. The release of the egg is
      called ovulation, and it occurs at the midpoint in the
      cycle - usually day 14 of a 28-day cycle, for example. An egg
      is released from alternating ovaries once a month.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Women don't usually feel their bodies ovulating,
      but some might notice mild cramping or experience
      PMS-like symptoms.&nbsp;
      Other women actually feel at their best during ovulation.
      It's different for different people. Sometimes a woman will
      have some spotting of blood for a day or two after ovulation.
      This is normal, but it is not her period.</p>

      <p>There are usually 14 - 16 days from ovulation to the
      beginning of a woman's period. However, the time from the
      beginning of your period to the next ovulation may vary -- it
      may be less than one week or it may be two weeks or
      more.&nbsp; From the ovary, the egg moves into one of the
      fallopian tubes.</p>

      <p>Once in the fallopian tube, one of two things can happen
      to the egg:
      	<ol>
      		<li>It can get fertilized by a male's sperm</li>
      		<li>It breaks down if not fertilized</li>
      	</ol></p>

      <p>If a male's sperm fertilizes the egg, the
      fertilized egg will take about 5 days to travel down the
      fallopian tube and attach to the thick, blood-rich lining of
      the uterus where it will nest and develop into a
      zygote.&nbsp; This is the beginning of a
      pregnancy.</p>

      <p>If it's not fertilized, the egg begins to fall apart, the
      estrogen and progesterone levels drop, and the uterine lining
      breaks down and is shed - this bleeding is what's known as
      your "period". The lining sheds and flows out of your
      uterus, through your cervix, through your
      vagina, and out of your body.</p>

      <p>Periods usually last from three to seven days. The flow
      usually starts light. It can get heavy for two or three days
      then get light again until it stops. It often starts off a
      rusty color, and then gets redder. It can then lighten up to
      a rust color again until it stops.</p>

      <p>If you keep track of when your period comes each month
      (mark it on a calendar), it will help you to figure out what
      your own personal cycle is. If you find that your cycle is
      fairly regular, it can help you predict when you'll get your
      period. But remember, your body is not a machine - your cycle
      can shift and change without warning.&nbsp;</p>

      <b>Knowing What's Regular and What's
      Irregular About Your Cycle</b><hr>


      <h4>Cramping and Dysmenorrhea<a href="menstruation___ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
      title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a></h4>

      <p>More than half of menstruating women experience cramp-like
      pain during their periods. Cramps are usually felt in the
      pelvic area and lower abdomen, but can radiate to the lower
      back or down the legs.</p>

      <p>Mechanically, cramps are like labor pains. Just as the
      uterus contracts to open up the cervix (neck of the uterus)
      and push out a baby, it contracts to expel menstrual blood.
      Often, after several years of menstruating or after
      childbirth, the cervical opening enlarges. The uterus doesn't
      have to contract as much to discharge the menstrual flow, so
      there is less cramping.</p>

      <p>Menstrual pain may also come from the bleeding process
      itself. When the uterine lining separates from the wall, it
      releases chemicals called prostaglandins.
      Prostaglandins cause blood vessels to narrow, impeding the
      supply of oxygen to the uterus. Just as the pain of a heart
      attack comes from insufficient blood to the muscles of the
      heart, too little blood to the uterine muscle might cause the
      pain of menstrual cramps.</p>

      <p>Menstrual pain can have other causes, although these are
      rare among younger women. They include:
      	<ul>
      		<li>Tumors</li>
      		<li>Fibroids</li>
			<li>Fallopian tube infection</li>
			<li>Endometriosis</li>
		</ul></p>

      <p>Sometimes, simple measures are all that's needed to feel
      better. Cutting down on salt might help reduce fluid buildup,
      and support hose may alleviate swelling in the legs or
      ankles. Crawling into bed for some extra rest or sleep is one
      way to deal with fatigue, and using a heating pad or hot
      water bottle eases cramps for some. Exercising also helps
      reduce pain in many young women, and may lift a blue mood as
      well.</p>

      <p>If symptoms interfere with work, school or sleep, the
      American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
      recommends seeing a doctor, who may suggest taking one or
      more medicines. Certain anti-inflammatory drugs called NSAIDs
      (an abbreviation for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)
      inhibit prostaglandin production, thus easing cramps.
      Prescription NSAIDs include naproxen (Naprosyn, Anaprox),
      ibuprofen (Motrin, IBU), indomethacin (Indocin), and
      mefenamic acid (Ponstel).</p>

      <p>If needed, your doctor may consider prescribing other pain
      medications or diuretics, or even oral contraceptives. It
      turns out that a possible positive side effect of birth
      control pills is relief of menstrual cramps.</p>

      <p>Over-the-counter acetaminophen products like Tylenol,
      Datril, and aspirin-free Anacin also may help menstrual pain.
      It takes time for pain relievers to work, so it's best to
      take them before the pain gets bad and continue for one or
      two days, as needed.</p>

      <p>Some 20 to 40 percent of menstruating women have
      experienced symptoms of PMS,
      or premenstrual syndrome.<a href="menstruation___ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
      title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a>&nbsp; Additionally, nearly 5% will experience
      premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a syndrome with
      specific symptoms that can interfere with work and
      interpersonal relationships during a certain time of the
      month.<a href="menstruation___ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup>[4]</sup></a>&nbsp;
      Starting anywhere from mid-cycle to a few days before
      menstruation begins, women with PMS may have one or all of a
      virtual laundry list of physical and emotional symptoms. They
      include:
      	<ul>
      		<li>Breast swelling and tenderness</li>
      		<li>Fluid retention</li>
			<li>Increased thirst or appetite</li>
			<li>Craving for sweets and salty foods</li>
			<li>Headaches</li>
			<li>Anxiety</li>
			<li>Restlessness</li>
			<li>Irritability</li>
			<li>Depression</li>
			<li>Hostility</li>
			<li>Loss of self confidence</li>
		</ul></p>

      <p>Experts say PMS doesn't usually affect teenagers. Its
      incidence increases with age and is more prevalent when women
      are in their 30s and 40s.</p>

      <div id="menstruation__dysmenorrhea"><hr>
      <b>Dysmenorrhea</b><a href="menstruation___ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=
      ""><sup>[5]</sup></a> <hr><p>
      Dysmenorrhea is severely painful menstruation that can
      interfere with a young woman's ability to attend
      school or study or sleep.&nbsp; This type of menstrual pain
      should be discussed with a doctor.<a href="menstruation___ftn6" name=
      "_ftnref6" title=""><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

      <p>There are two kinds of painful menses--primary and
      secondary dysmenorrhea--and it is very important to
      distinguish between them so both are treated properly.</p>

      <p><i>Primary dysmenorrhea</i> - usually
      starts within three years of the onset of menstruation and
      lasts one or two days each month. While this type of
      menstrual pain may lessen for some women as they grow older
      or after the birth of children, it also can continue until
      menopause.</p>

      <p><i>Secondary dysmenorrhea</i> - is
      menstrual pain caused by disease such as pelvic inflammatory
      disease, endometriosis (abnormalities in the lining of
      the uterus), or uterine fibroids link to fibroids page
      (nonmalignant growths). A hint that the disease might be the
      cause of menstrual pain is if the pain also occurs during
      intercourse or during other parts of the menstrual cycle.</p>

      <p>Primary dysmenorrhea is a result of the normal production
      of prostaglandins--chemical substances that are made by cells
      in the lining of the uterus. (Prostaglandins are also
      produced elsewhere throughout the body.) The lining of the
      uterus--which has built up and thickened during the early
      stages of the menstrual cycle--breaks up and is sloughed off
      at the end of the cycle and releases prostaglandins. The
      prostaglandins, in turn, make the uterus contract more
      strongly than at any other time of the cycle. They can even
      cause it to contract so much that the blood supply is cut off
      temporarily, depriving the uterine muscle of oxygen and thus
      causing pain. Women who suffer painful contractions may be
      producing excessive amounts of prostaglandins.</p>

      <p>The cramps themselves help push out the menstrual
      discharge. Because the cervical opening is often widened
      after childbirth or years of menstruation, cramps may lessen
      in severity later in life.</p>

      <p>Most women describe their menstrual cramps as a dull
      aching or a pressure low in the abdomen. The pains may wax
      and wane, remain constant, or be so severe that they cause
      nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, backache, sweating, and an ache
      that spreads to the hips, lower back, and thighs.</p>

      [ <a href="#menstruation__top">To Top</a> ]
    </div>

      <div id="menstruation__amenorrhea"><hr>
      <b>Amenorrhea</b><hr>

      <p><i>Regular Flow and Amenorrhea<a href="menstruation___ftn7" name=
      "_ftnref7" title=""><sup>[7]</sup></a></i></p>

      <p>Many young women have very irregular periods for the first
      couple years of menstruation.&nbsp; Young women also
      don't ovulate regularly every month, which makes it
      difficult to know you are ovulating. Therefore, a woman
      should assume that she could get pregnant every month, even
      if she has irregular periods.</p>

      <p>Eventually, periods usually become regular, but even when
      they do, a missed or late period once a year--especially at a
      stressful time--is considered normal. Also, just as strenuous
      exercise and eating disorders can delay the onset of
      menstruation, they can also cause previously regular
      menstrual cycles to become irregular or stop completely.</p>

      <p>Amenorrhea<a href="menstruation___ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><sup>[8]</sup></a> ,
      or the absence of periods, is divided into two
      categories:</p>

      	<ul>
      		<li>Primary amenorrhea &ETH; menstruation has never taken
      place. It fails to occur at puberty.</li>

      		<li>Secondary amenorrhea -- menstruation starts but then
      stops. The absence of menstruation during pregnancy is a form
      of physiologic secondary amenorrhea (physiologic in the sense
      that it is completely normal and is not caused by anything
      harmful). Amenorrhea during lactation is another type
      of physiologic secondary amenorrhea.</li>
      	</ul>

      <p><i>Secondary Amenorrhea<a href="menstruation___ftn9" name="_ftnref9"
      title=""><sup>[9]</sup></a></i></p>

      <p>A period that is 2-3 weeks overdue should be investigated
      to rule out pregnancy. Stress and changes in environment are
      responsible for most cases of missed periods in adolescents.
      Young women are especially likely to have irregular periods
      with fevers, emotional upset, weight loss, changes in
      environment, or increased participation in competitive
      athletics.&nbsp; Amenorrhea is also a symptom of anorexia
      nervosa.  If you have signs of amenorrhea, contact a doctor
      to make sure that it is normal and to prevent further
      complications.</p>
