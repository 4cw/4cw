    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">What are Ovarian Cysts?</span></b>
    <hr>


      <p>The ovaries produce the eggs in the female reproductive
      system. Eggs grow, develop, and mature in the ovaries and
      then are released during ovulation, part of the monthly
      menstrual cycle that
      occurs during the childbearing years. Ovarian cysts are
      fluid-filled sacs that form on the ovaries when the follicles
      (sacs) on the ovary that contain the egg mature, but do not
      release the egg into the fallopian tube where it would be
      fertilized. A woman can develop one cyst or many cysts.
      Ovarian cysts can vary in size-from as small as a pea to as
      big as a grapefruit. Most cysts are small and do not cause
      symptoms. Some cysts might cause a dull ache in the abdomen
      because they are twisted, bleeding, or have burst; others
      might cause pain during sexual intercourse. Most cysts are
      benign (not cancerous). A few cysts, though, may turn out to
      be malignant (cancerous). For this reason, your doctor should
      check all cysts. If ovarian cysts are found early, many of
      the problems they cause can be treated. There are different
      types of ovarian cysts:</p>

      <p><i></i></p>

      <p><i>Functional cysts</i> - These cysts are completely
      normal and form during ovulation. The follicles (sacs) on the
      ovary that contain the egg often do not mature, and become
      cysts. These cysts usually disappear during menstruation,
      before another menstrual cycle begins. If not, they will
      shrink in about one to three months. Your doctor may want to
      check in a few months to make sure the cyst has gotten
      smaller. Only women who are ovulating form functional cysts.
      If a woman is in <b>menopause</b> define or past menopause
      and not having periods, she should not have functional
      cysts.</p>

      <p><i>Endometriomas</i> - These cysts develop in women who
      have endometriosis, a condition in which tissue from the
      lining of the uterus (endometrium) grows in other areas, such
      as on the fallopian tubes, the ovaries, and on other organs
      outside of the uterus in the

     These may be filled
      with a thick, brown blood and so also are called "chocolate
      cysts." Because uterine tissue is sensitive to hormones, even
      when it's located outside the uterus, the tissue will bleed
      monthly, which may cause the formation of a growing cyst on
      the ovary. These cysts can be painful during sexual
      intercourse and during menstruation.</p>

      <p><i>Benign cystic tumors</i>(cystadenomas) - These tumors
      are non-cancerous and are often filled with a fatty liquid.
      They develop from cells on the outer surface of the ovary.
      Some of these tumors, called dermoid cysts, are lined with
      structures such as hair, or pieces of bone. They are often
      small and may not cause symptoms. They can, however, become
      large and uncomfortable.</p>

      <p><i>Multiple Cysts</i> - Women who do not ovulate regularly
      can develop multiple cysts. This is a disorder in which the
      ovaries are enlarged and contain many small cysts. This can
      be caused by a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome
      (PCOS). Symptoms of PCOS include irregular menstrual periods,
      infertility, and increased body hair.</p>

    <hr>
      <p>Many women may have functional cysts or benign cystic
      tumors without having any symptoms. Sometimes, though, a cyst
      will swell large enough to cause pressure or pain in the
      abdomen. The cysts also may put pressure on the urinary tract
      and cause problems with urine flow. Some women may have pain
      during sexual intercourse. Although it is rare, it is
      possible for a very large cyst to become twisted, stopping
      its own supply of blood. This can cause nausea, fever, and
      severe abdominal pain. In women with endometriosis, ovarian
      cysts can cause the commonly felt symptoms of pelvic pain,
      painful menstrual periods, abnormal bleeding and painful
      sexual intercourse.</p>

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">When are Women Most Likely to Have Ovarian Cysts?</span></b>
    <hr>
      <p>Ovarian cysts are very common during the childbearing
      years so that means as college women many of us will have
      them. Most often, cysts in women of this age group are not
      cancerous. Women who are past menopause (ages 50-70),
      however, and have ovarian cysts, have a higher risk of having
      ovarian cancer. If you are over 50 and have an ovarian cyst,
      your doctor will probably want to do surgery to remove it.
      However, if you think you might have a cyst, at any age, you
      should tell your health care provider.</p>

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">How are Ovarian Cysts Diagnosed and Treated?</span></b>
    <hr>


      <p>Ovarian cysts usually are found during routine pelvic
      examinations. During this examination, your doctor is able to
      feel the swelling of the cyst on your ovary. Once a cyst is
      found, the doctor may perform an ultrasound, or a screening
      to see if the cyst is hollow or solid, determine its size and
      exact location, and see if it contains fluid or abnormal
      structures that help show its type. The doctor may decide to
      "wait and see" if the cyst will shrink on its own in a few
      months. If you frequently develop cysts, your doctor may
      prescribe <b>birth control pills</b> link to contraception
      page to section on these to prevent you from ovulating. This
      will prevent follicles from developing and new cysts from
      forming. Your doctor might talk with you about birth control
      pills, and if they are right for you.</p>

      <p>If the cyst does not go away after several menstrual
      periods, if it has gotten larger or more painful, or it does
      not appear to be a functional cyst, your doctor may want to
      perform other tests or procedures to look at and remove the
      cyst. To detect your risk for ovarian cancer, your doctor may
      want to do a blood test to measure a substance in the blood
      called CA-125. The amount of this protein is increased in the
      blood of women with ovarian cancer. However, some ovarian
      cancers do not produce enough CA-125 to be detected by the
      test, and there are other non-cancerous diseases that also
      increase the levels of CA-125. For these reasons, the CA-125
      test is recommended mostly for women who are at high risk for
      the disease.</p>

      <p>If the cyst is small and looks benign on the ultrasound,
      your doctor may perform a laparoscopy. This procedure is done
      under general anesthesia on an outpatient basis and allows
      the doctor to closely examine all of your reproductive
      organs. A very small incision is made above or below the
      navel, and a small instrument called a laparoscope that acts
      like a telescope is inserted into the abdomen. If the cyst is
      small and looks benign, it can be removed after the doctor
      makes very small incisions in the pubic hairline.</p>

      <p>If the cyst is too large to remove this way, the doctor
      may perform a procedure called a laparotomy. This procedure
      involves making bigger incisions in the stomach to remove the
      cyst. While you are under general anesthesia, the doctor is
      able to have the cyst tested to find out if the tissue is
      cancerous. If it is cancerous, the doctor will then be able
      to remove other tissue that could be affected, like the
      ovary, fallopian tubes, uterus, or lymph nodes. Before any
      surgery, your doctor will talk to you about what will happen
      during the surgery, the risks, and how long it will take you
      to recover. It is important to remember that most cysts are
      not cancerous and are relatively harmless if treated
      properly.</p>

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Myths and Facts about Ovarian Cysts</span></b>
    <hr>

      <p>All Ovarian Cysts are malignant</p>

      <blockquote>This is a myth.  In fact, most Ovarian Cysts are
      benign (non-cancerous).  Since functional cysts are
      common during menstruation, they often appear and disappear
      quickly without causing harm.</blockquote>

      <p>Ovarian Cysts can affect women of any age group</p>

      <blockquote>Fact.  Although they occur most often during a
      woman's child-bearing years (puberty to menopause), they may
      occur at any time.  In fact, women during menopause are
      more prone to ovarian cancer.</blockquote>

      <p>Ovarian Cysts can grow as large as the size of an egg and
      may contain follicles and cartilage. </p>

      <blockquote>Fact.  These types of cysts are called dermoids and
      come from undeveloped tissue forming into, usually, a
      non-cancerous growth over a period of time.</blockquote>

      <p>Some complicated forms of Ovarian Cysts require surgical
      removal and some may go away on their own</p>

      <blockquote>Fact.  Since some cysts are f unctional and thus
      present during the menstrual cycle, they are usually harmless
      and disintegrate on their own.  However, cysts that are
      non-functional and may affect the ovary with their size
      and/or location need to be removed.</blockquote>

      <p>Biopsy is recommended for ALL women diagnosed with an
      Ovarian Cyst.</p>

      <blockquote>Myth.  Since some cysts are functional and are
      directly linked with the menstrual cycle, they mostly
      dissolve on their own.  However, a biopsy may be advised
      when a cyst persists or causes symptoms so that your doctor
      can determine whether the growth is cancerous or
      non-cancerous.</blockquote>

      <p>There is no known way to prevent functional Ovarian
      Cysts.</p>

      <blockquote>Fact.  They are part of a natural biological process
      and are often present during ovulation.  Therefore,
      there is no method of preventing cyst formation.
      However, birth control pills may help women who are
      constantly forming cysts and experiencing heavy menstrual
      cycles.  Birth control pills stabilize your period and
      help minimize cyst formation in many women.</blockquote>
