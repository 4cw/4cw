    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Your Menstrual Cycle</span></b>
    <hr>
      <p>The menstrual cycle is a finely tuned sequence of events your
      body controls in order to prepare for a potential
      pregnancy.? A girl first experiences a menstrual period,
      which is characterized by monthly bleeding, during a time
      called puberty, usually during her teen years.? The
      menstrual cycle involves many factors and is regulated
      through the increase and decrease in the amounts of different
      hormones present. A part of your brain called the
      hypothalamus controls the release of hormones like the
      follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and leutenizing hormone
      (LH).? FSH causes the eggs in the follicles of the
      ovaries to mature.? When an egg is mature a surge of the
      hormone estrogen triggers LH to stimulate the release of the
      egg from the follicle (ovulation) so that it can travel down
      the fallopian tubes to the uterus where it can be fertilized
      by a sperm.? Meanwhile, the discarded follicle, now
      called the corpus leuteum causes increased amounts of the
      hormones estrogen and progesterone to prepare your body for
      the egg that may become fertilized to produce a baby.?
      However, the corpus leuteum only lasts for a short while, and
      when it degrades completely the hormone levels decrease and
      the menstrual bleeding begins, removing the egg and preparing
      the body for the cycle to begin again.

      <p>Once the day comes when you have your menstrual period,
      before dealing with cramps, bloating or any other symptoms,
      the most basic thing you have to deal with is figuring out
      what kind of feminine protection works best for you. There
      are many choices that catch or absorb your flow.?
      Additionally, you should wash the area daily with mild soap
      and water? In the past, women had very few menstrual
      product options to use during menstruation.? Cloth pads
      were the usual menstrual "device" before the
      introduction of commercial disposable pads in the late
      1800�s. The first disposable pad in 1921 measured 22
      inches (56 cm.) long, and the filler was 3.5 inches (9 cm.)
      wide<a href="menstrualproducts___ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a>. Today
      there are various options available, but it is important to
      use the product that is right for you. Here is a list of
      various menstrual products with descriptions of what they are
      and where they can be found.</p>

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Sanitary Napkins</span></b>
    <hr>

      <p>Sanitary napkins, most commonly referred to as pads, are worn
      outside the body and placed in the underwear. There are
      various options available regarding materials used.
      Disposable pads are thrown away after each use and can be
      purchased just about anywhere. They are usually rectangular
      wads of cotton inside a liner. They have a sticky backing so
      they can be affixed to your underwear and come in different
      sizes and thicknesses, some with "wings" so that
      they wrap around the sides of your underwear to prevent
      stains</p>

      <p>Reusable or washable pads used by some women are rinsed
      out after each use. Women in our society have tended not to
      use reusable pads because they are seen as an ancient way of
      protecting yourself during your period.</p>

      <p>Some women with sensitive skin prefer the reusable pads
      because they cause less rashes and skin irritation from the
      friction between the sanitary napkin and the skin. Washable
      pads are more difficult to find in stores; the best places to
      look are online.</p>

      <p>Pads can be worn until they are fully saturated, usually
      4-6 hours, however there are some specific varieties for
      nighttime use. When menstrual blood comes in contact with the
      air, it dries and develops an odor. Controlling the odor is
      simple, just change your pad regularly, at least a few times
      a day and whenever the pad becomes soaked through.</p>

  <div id="menstrualproducts__tampons"><hr/>
    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Tampons</span></b>
    <hr>
      <p>Tampons are cylinders made of cotton, rayon or other
      synthetic fibers. They are inserted into vagina, where they
      absorb menstrual flow before it leaves your body. Tampons are
      inserted with a finger or by using a disposable cardboard or
      plastic applicator. A string attached to the tampon hangs
      outside the body so you can remove the tampon by pulling on
      the string.
      Women have probably used tampons for thousands of years, but
      the first commercial tampons were sold in the 1920�s
      and 1930�s.</p>

      <p>Different companies make their tampons out of different
      materials. Some companies sell "environmentally friendly"
      tampons made without additives and with unbleached cotton.
      Also, tampons come in many different absorbencies, ranging
      from light flow to super plus absorbency.</p>

      <p>Tampons, when inserted correctly, are quite comfortable
      and can�t be felt at all. At first, it may take a
      little practice to get the hang of inserting and removing
      them, but, after a while, most women find them to be pretty
      convenient. If you are a first time user, you may prefer
      tampons that come with an applicator. Tampons without
      applicators have to be pushed inside with your finger, and it
      can be a little harder to find the right spot. Whichever
      tampon you purchase will come with detailed instructions on
      how to insert it<a href="menstrualproducts___ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><sup>[6]</sup></a>. Check the <a href="menstrualproducts__resources">other resources</a>
      section for websites that offer detailed
      instructions and pictures for first time users.</p>

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Tampon Safety</span></b>
    <hr>
      <p>There is a small danger of developing <u>TSS (Toxic Shock
      Syndrome)</u> when using tampons. Read about TSS and how to
      prevent it from the <a href=
      "http://www.fda.gov/opacom/catalog/ots_tss.html">FDA</a>.
      Symptoms of TSS include a sudden high fever, vomiting,
      diarrhea, dizziness, and/or fainting.**? While you are
      at risk for TSS when using tampons, the risks have been
      lessened over the past 20 years. <a href=

      If you change tampons regularly (every 4-6 hours) tampons are
      generally safe<a href="menstrualproducts___ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><sup>[7]</sup></a>.</p>

      <p>Recently, there has been some controversy and concern about
      the safety of tampons. Some are concerned that the tampons
      being sold in the United States and elsewhere may be
      contaminated with asbestos and/or dioxins (chemicals that
      have been linked to a variety of health problems, including
      cancer, infertility and immune system diseases). The Food and
      Drug Administration continues to insist that tampons are
      safe. There is, however, a lack of conclusive research on
      this topic.</p>

  <div id="menstrualproducts__cup"><hr/>
    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Menstrual Cup</span></b>
    <hr>

      <p>The menstrual cup is a relatively new means of menstrual
      protection introduced in the 1990s in the United States.
      Similar to a diaphragm, the cup is a small, flexible latex or
      rubber device that you insert inside the vagina and can be
      work up to 12 hours. You take it out and empty it regularly
      (when the cup fills up with blood), then put it back in
      again. The cup holds tight against your body with to prevent
      leakage.? However, the cup may require a higher level of
      comfort with your own body than either of the other methods.
      There are two varieties of cups: disposable and reusable.
      Some disposable brands are used once and thrown away and some
      are used for the duration of the period and then disposed of
      afterwards. The reusable brand can be used up to 10 years or
      more. Disposable menstrual cups can be found at certain
      health and beauty stores. The reusable cup can only be found
      online and is FDA accepted.? Some women with active
      lifestyles find the cup to be reliable, comfortable and
      cleaner than other products. Women that are uncomfortable
      with the site of blood might want to opt for a different
      product.<a href="menstrualproducts___ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a></p>
