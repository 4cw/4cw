    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">What is Herpes?</span></b>
    <hr>

       Herpes is a contagious viral infection caused by the HERPES
      simplex virus (HSV). It affects 30 million
      Americans. And as many as 50,000 new cases occur each year (1).
      <P><B>Types of herpes</B><BR>Herpes is caused by a virus called herpes simplex virus (HSV). There are two types of
      HSV. HSV type 1 tends to cause sores on the lips (known as fever blisters
      or cold sores), but it can also infect the genitals. HSV type 2 causes
      sores on the genitals, but does, at times, also affect the mouth.</p>
      <P><B>How it spreads</B><BR>Herpes most often spreads through skin-to-skin
      contact with active soars. Since the virus can infect both the mouth and
      the genital area, it commonly spreads through sexual intercourse, oral
      sex, and through contact with someone who recently touched a sore. HERPES can also live on inanimate objects. While
      such infections are rare, you should avoid sharing a towel with a person
      who has an active herpes outbreak.</p>
      <P>Sometimes people have herpes outbreaks
      that are not visible. Therefore, you should always use condoms when having
      sex with a person who has herpes, regardless of whether or not the partner
      has a visible outbreak.</p>
      <P><B>Length and frequency</B><BR>The length of an initial herpes episode is usually 2-3 weeks. After this,
      the virus will travel to the sensory nerves at the end of the spinal cord,
      where it will remain in an inactive state. In most people the virus
      will reactivate at times. After the first, herpes episodes usually last a day and occur at the
      same site as the original infection. All outbreaks of herpes are contagious.</p>
      <P>Herpes recurrences vary in frequency and severity between person to
      person. Some people will only have one or two outbreaks in their life,
      while others may experience several attacks a year. The pattern of
      recurrences changes in most individuals over time.</p>

    <hr>
      <p>
      Symptoms of an initial episode of herpes
      usually appear 2 to 12 days after being exposed to the virus. Typical
      early symptoms are:
      <UL>
        <LI>An itching or burning sensation</li>
        <LI>Pain in the legs, buttocks, or genital area</li>
        <LI>Vaginal discharge</li>
        <LI>Abdominal pain or pressure </LI></UL> </p><p> Within a few days, sores appear
      near where the virus has entered the body, i.e. the mouth or genital
      region. They also can occur inside the vagina, on the cervix, or in the
      urinary passage. At the beginning, small red bumps appear. These bumps
      then develop into blisters, and, later, become painful open sores. Over
      several days, the sores become crusty and then heal without leaving a
      scar. Some other symptoms that are associated with the first episode of
      genital herpes are:
      <UL>
        <LI>Fever</li>
        <LI>Headache</li>
        <LI>Muscle aches</li>
        <LI>PAINFUL OR DIFFICULT URINATION</li>
        <LI>Swollen glands in the groin area. </LI></UL> </p><p>IF YOU ARE HAVING
      DIFFICULTY URINATING, OR IF YOU EXPERIENCE PAIN WHILE URINATING, CALL YOUR
      DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY!!!</p>
      <P><B>Diagnosis</B><BR>Because herpes can
      appear differently in every individual, accurate diagnosis is essential. A
      doctor may administer a blood test to check if the HSV is in the body. A
      blood test, however, will not reveal whether the individual can pass the
      herpes virus to another person. To determine
      whether herpes is contagious, the doctor will
      touch a cotton swab to an active legion to obtain a sample of the fluid
      for testing.</p>

       Since herpes is contagious, it is very
      important to take a few precautionary steps to avoid spreading the virus:
      <UL>
        <LI>keep the infected area clean and dry</li>
        <LI>try to avoid touching the sores</li>
        <LI>wash hands after contact</li>
        <LI>avoid sexual contact from the time the symptoms are first recognized
        until the sores have healed </LI></UL></p> <p>There are several methods of
      minimize the pain and discomfort associated with herpes outbreaks.
      <UL>
        <LI>Salt Baths: To clean, soothe, and dry the soars in the vaignal area,
        use 1 tablespoon of salt for every 600ml of water, or about a handful of
        salt for a shallow bath.</li>
        <LI>Pain relievers</li>
        <LI>Loose cotton underwear can help alleviate discomfort and encourage
        the healing process </LI></UL></p>
      <P><B>Medication</B><BR>There is no cure for herpes. Three drugs are
      currently available to help reduce the severity and frequency of the
      virus.</p>
      <P><B>Acyclovir</B> is a drug that can shorten the length of the initial
      herpes episode and make recurrences less
      severe. Acyclovir can be taken orally and must be taken with 24 hours of
      the onset of symptoms. Acyclovir has uncommon side effects including
      headaches, nausea, and diarrhea.</p>
      <P><B>Famciclovir</B> is a drug that is used to treat recurrences and
      prevent future outbreaks. Famciclovir reduces the amount of pain and the
      length of the recurrences. The side effects of famciclovir are mild with
      headache and nausea being most commonly reported.</p>
      <P><B>Valacyclovir</B> is a third drug that helps soars heal faster and
      reduces both the period of pain and the contagious period of the virus. In
      clinical tests, valacyclovir prevented the development of blisters in one
      third more patients who took the drug within 24 hours of noticing the
      first symptoms of the outbreak, compared to those who took a placebo
      (dummy pill) (3).</p>
      <P><B>Alternative Therapies</B><BR>Some people use organic interventions
      to treat herpes. Two of the most commonly used are L-lysine and red marine
      algae. L-lysine is an amino acid that is
      found naturally in some foods. L-lysine is thought to slow the replication
      of HSV, especially HSV1. To maximize the efficiency of this amino acid,
      500 mg (miligrams) to 1,000 mg should be taken on an empty stomach, and
      the intake of foods such as nuts, seeds, peas, and chocolate should be
      reduced. The second uses red marine algae. In some lab tests, red marine
      algae has been shown to inhibit herpes virus,
      however definitive tests to evaluate this intervention in humans are
      lacking (4).</p>

       Though we do not know what causes the outbreaks, recurrences are thought
      to be triggered by:
      <UL>
        <LI>Stress</li>
        <LI>Other illness</li>
        <LI>Menstruation</li>
        <LI>Fatigue</li>
        <LI>Exposure to sunlight </LI></UL> </p><p>While outbreaks are never predictable,
      the number of outbreaks can be reduced through:
      <UL>
        <LI>A proper diet and exercise to build up the immune system</li>
        <LI>Proper amount of sleep</li>
        <LI>Stress management techniques, such as meditation</li>
        <LI>Avoiding extended exposure to sunlight </LI></UL></p>

    <hr>
      <p>
      Herpes can be spread to an infant during birth. The risk is greatest in
      babies whose mother contracts HSV during the final trimester of birth. The
      virus can be spread to a child through:
      <UL>
        <LI>HSV being present in the birth canal during delivery.</li>
        <LI>Kissing by someone who suffers from cold sores.</li>
        <LI>In rare instances, by touching an active cold sore and immediately
        touching the baby. </LI></UL> </p><p> If the mother contracted the HSV virus before
      pregnancy, she will rarely pass the virus to her child. Regardless of when
      a woman is first infected, if she has herpes
      and is pregnant she should see a doctor.</p>
