      <p>Your personal safety is something you should take the time
      to learn about. In this fact sheet you will find several
      dimensions to self-defense and personal safety. First, find
      resources and safety services at your college campus. Second,
      think about the places and times that could be
      dangerous.  Take measures to avoid these and keep out of
      harm's way.  Third, help yourself, or a friend,
      leave an abusive relationship. Fourth, check out self-defense
      courses in your area. Lastly, learn about safety devices. Are
      they a fad or do they really protect you?</p>

    <hr>


      <p>If someone plans to hurt you it would be helpful for you
      to know how to defend yourself. You may be scared that you
      are not strong enough or the person that is trying to hurt
      you may do more damage if you try and fight back. This is
      normal.  However, learning some self-defense techniques
      and building confidence may save your life.</p>

    <hr>


      <p>Evaluate the safety and security of the places on campus
      and the quality and availability of resources to ensure
      safety. For example, find out about campus escort services
      often offered through campus security and student government
      programs.</p>

      <p>Do not walk by yourself at night. Walk with a friend or
      use a campus escort service.</p>

      <p>Report any violence that you see to orientation and
      awareness programs on campus. Help develop effective linkages
      between campus and community law enforcement personnel.</p>

      <p>Do not let anyone into your dorm who looks like they
      don't belong there.</p>

      <p>Support a coordinated community response/ college
      initiative to prevent violence against women.</p>


      <p>Provide a voice for women on campus. Start a support group
      and/or victim advocacy group on campus.</p>



      <p>Take a self-defense course.</p>

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Carjacking</span></b>
    <hr>

      <p>Since newer cars are being built with anti-theft devices,
      thieves have begun to focus their attention on easier options
      such as carjacking, the process of stealing a car while
      someone is inside.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><b>What should I do to prevent myself from being
      carjacked?</b></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Before you enter your car, check to see if anyone is
		  hiding in your back seat.</li>

		  <li>Get into your car quickly by having your keys ready.</li>

		  <li>Keep in mind when you enter your car that someone may want
		  to steal it.</li>

		  <li>Once you get into your car, lock it immediately.</li>

		  <li>Make sure your windows are rolled up all the way.</li>

		  <li>Leave space between your car and the car in front of yours
		  when you approach a stop so that you have enough room to pull
		  away from a potential carjacker.</li>
		</ul>



      <p><b>I am being carjacked! What should I do?</b></p>


		<ul>
		  <li>It may be best to let the carjacker take your car, but
		  make sure you are NOT in it.</li>
		  <li>Remember that if you are being threatened with a weapon,
		  you should protect yourself and not your car.</li>

			<b>How can I prevent purse snatching?</b>
			<ul>
			  <li>Do not carry a purse</li>

			  <li>Carry your purse under your jacket or in a way that makes

			  <li>Avoid wearing your purse diagonally from your shoulder to
			  opposite hip. A purse-snatcher can quickly pull the strap

			  <li>Place your arm around your purse, holding it close to your

      <p><b>Do I give up my purse to the snatcher?</b></p>
	<blockquote>
      <p>This is up to you. Giving up your purse really depends on
      how dangerous of a position you will be in if you do not give
      it up. Just remember that your life is more important than a
      few treasures inside your purse. If you decide to fight back,
      make sure that you are trained and that the assailant is not
      carrying any weapons.  In almost all cases it's
      better to give up your purse.  If your purse is snatched
      try to remember identifying characteristics about the person
      who stole it from you and call the police or 911
      immediately.</p>

      <p><b>What should I do to prevent being stalked?</b></p>

      <p>In most areas, stalking is illegal because stalking can
      result in a dangerous situation. Stalkers may be inconsistent
      with how many times or ways they stalk you. If you are
      starting to feel uncomfortable, try to pick up on signs of a
      stalker and report it immediately to the police.</p>

      <p>Record each stalking incident. If you know the person who
      is stalking you, get a restraining order, even if you think
      it will be violated.</p>

      <b>Domestic Abuse</b><a href="selfdefense___ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=

      <p>Sometimes it can be difficult to tell if domestic abuse is
      occurring.  There are several different signs that you
      can look for to figure out whether you or someone you know is
      being domestically abused.  These include:
      	<ul>
		  <li>Someone keeping track of you all the time</li>

		  <li>Constant accusations of your being unfaithful</li>

		  <li>Physical abuse (such as hitting, smacking, etc.)</li>

		  <li>Being forced to have sex against your will</li>

		  <li>Being humiliated in front of others</li>

		  <li>Feeling that you are criticized too often</li>

		  <li>Preventing you from seeing friends and family</li>
		</ul></p>

      <p>If this sounds like a life you or someone you know is
      living, there is help out there.  Do not try to solve
      the problem on your own, seek advice from
      professionals.  You can contact your local police
      department for a listing of women's shelters or check

      <dd>A noisemaker, usually operated by battery that makes a

      <p><dt><i>Why aren't personal alarms the best choice for
      ensuring safety?</i></dt></p>



      <dd>While the loud noise may startle an attacker, often times
      the noise will go unheard or ignored by other people around
      you without helping you out of the dangerous situation.

      <p>When you rely on blowing the alarm you put your safety

      <p>Stun guns are held in your hand and are operated by
      battery.</p>

      <p>There are two metal prongs, which need to be pressed
      against the attacker for the shock.</p></dd>



      <dt><i>Why stun guns are effective:</i></dt>

      <dd>Stun guns interfere with your attacker's

      <p><dt><i>Are stun guns legal?</i></dt></p>



      <dd>It depends on where you live. You should check with a
      lawyer, your police department, or your state's attorney
      general. You should probably check with more than one of
      these sources, or do your own investigation and read the laws
      yourself. You can find copies of your state's statutes at

      <li>OC (Oleoresin Capsicum) - Pepper Spray</li>

      <li>CS (Orthochlorobenzalmalononitrile) - Super Tear Gas</li>

      </ul></dd>



      <p><dt><i>What is Oleoresin Capsicum (pepper) spray?</i></dt></p>



      <dd>Pepper spray (OC) is an inflammatory that has a
      physiological effect on the attacker.

      Physiological effects include:
		<ul>
      <li>Eye lids slam shut or spasm</li>

      <li>Blood vessel dilation</li>

      <li>Brachial tube constriction when inhaled</li>

      <li>Mucus membrane secretion and blood to rushing to the upper
      body</li>
		</ul>


      <p>Pepper spray may protect you against many people and
      animals. It may be not be effective on everyone.</p>



      <p>Pepper spray needs to be tested before carrying it to use
      and shaken at least once a month so ingredients do not
      separate.</p></dd>



      <dt><i>Are Mace and OC spray legal?</i></dt>



      <dd>Each state has its own laws governing the legal use of
      mace and OC spray. In Massachusetts, it's considered
      ammunition and you need a license to purchase and possess it.
      In New York, for example, it's illegal no matter what. It's
      also illegal under FAA regulations to have either in checked
      luggage or carry-on luggage on any airplane.  So check
      with your state government or police to find out if pepper
      spray is legal where you live</dd>



      <p><dt><i>Where can I buy OC spray?</i></dt></p>



      <dd>Many places, including hardware stores, firearms stores
      and supermarkets.</dd>



      <p><i>Why do I need a class to learn to use it?</i></p>



      <dd>Police aren't allowed to carry pepper spray until they
      take a class. In the same way, you should have training to
      avoid inappropriate use of OC. These inappropriate uses
      include holding it too near, too far, or using too much
      spray.</dd>
