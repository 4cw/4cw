    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Introduction</span></b>
    <hr> <p>The words &quot;date&quot; and &quot;rape&quot; are not
	words that we should ever have to associate together.&nbsp; When you think of &quot;date&quot;, you think of dinner and
	a movie, or a picnic at the beach, and when you think about the word
	&quot;rape&quot;, you want to picture a dark alley in a deserted part of town
	and a slimy man with a mask.</p>

	<p>In reality, though, 90 percent of rapes are not reported and
	in 60 percent of those cases that are reported, the victim knew her
	assailant.&nbsp; A study by the National
	Center for the Prevention and Control of Rape showed that 92 percent of
	adolescent rape victims said that they were acquainted with their attackers.<a href="dateRape___ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=
    ""><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

	<p>According to a report done by the National Institute of
	Justice, it is estimated that approximately 5% of college women were raped in a
	one-year period.<a href="dateRape___ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=
    ""><sup>[2]</sup></a> On a college campus of 10,000 that would mean that 500 women were victimized during a single year.</p>

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Causes of Date Rape</span></b>
    <hr> <p>There are many causes for date rape, but none of them fault
	the victim.&nbsp; Common causes include:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>&quot;Miscommunication&quot;-- she said &quot;no&quot;, but he heard &quot;maybe&quot;.</li>
	<li> Drug or alcohol abuse-- after a few too many drinks it can sometimes be difficult to
	distinguish between what we should be doing and what we are doing.</li>
	<li> Men who do not respect women-- men who carry a stereotype of women as being weak or
	incapable of speaking for themselves often will not respect a woman's wishes
	with regard to sex, as well as other issues.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>One of the most common associated risks for date rape is
	alcohol and drug abuse.&nbsp; In
	college, date rape is most common at parties or in situations where one or both
	people involved will be drinking.</p>

  <div id="dateRape__rohypnol"><hr/>
    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Rohypnol</span></b>
    <hr> <p>In recent years, it has become increasingly popular for men
	to &quot;spike&quot; women's drinks with what have come to be known as
	&nbsp; &quot;date-rape drugs&quot;.&nbsp; These drugs are commonly known as: </p>
	<ul>
	<li>roofies</li>
	<li>rophies</li>
	<li>R2</li>
	<li>roofenol</li>
	<li>Roche</li>
	<li>roachies</li>
	<li>la rocha</li>
	<li>rope</li>
	<li>rib</li>
	<li>circles</li>
	<li>Mexican valium</li>
	<li>roach-2</li>
	<li>ropies</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The technical name is Rohypnol.</p>
	<p>Rohypnol has surfaced as part of the party scene and is
	prescribed as a sleeping pill in other countries. &nbsp;Because it is prescribed as treatment for insomnia and as a
	sedative, its effects are similar to those of Valium (diazepam), but is about
	ten times stronger.</p>
	<p>If the drug makes its way into your drink there is no way
	that you will be able to tell until it's too late because you cannot taste or
	smell it; once hidden in your drink it becomes undetectable.&nbsp; The best way to protect yourself from
	this kind of drug-induced date rape is to be aware.&nbsp; Don't leave your drink unattended and watch your drink to
	make sure no one slips anything into it.</p>
	<p>At a party where drugs are present, you can recognize
	Rohypnol because it is white, scored on one side with the word
	&quot;ROCHE&quot; and is encircled either once or twice on the other side,
	depending on the dosage of the pill.<a href="dateRape___ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=
    ""><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>
	<p>Rohypnol is illegal in the United States.&nbsp; However, it is produced and sold
	legally by prescription in Europe and Latin America, and is smuggled into our
	country.</p>
	<p>Rohypnol IS POPULAR because it is inexpensive--sold at less than $05.00 per tablet.</p>
[ <a href="#dateRape__top">To Top</a> ]  </div>
  <div id="dateRape__effects"><hr/>
    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Effects of taking Rohypnol</span></b>
    <hr> <ul>
	<li>impaired judgement and motor skills</li>
	<li>Combining alcohol and Rohypnol is particularly hazardous because together, they have a
	much greater effect on memory and judgement.</li>
	<li>Effects begin within thirty minutes, peak within two hours, and can persist for up to
	eight hours.</li>
	<li>The combination of alcohol and Rohypnol can cause &quot;blackouts&quot; lasting
	eight to twenty-four hours.</li>
	<li>Loss of inhibitions (losing your social inhibitions and judgement) is another widely
	reported effect of Rohypnol, when taken alone or in combination with alcohol.</li>
	<li>decreased blood pressure</li>
	<li>memory impairment</li>
	<li>drowsiness</li>
	<li>visual disturbances</li>
	<li>dizziness</li>
	<li>confusion</li>
	<li>urine retention</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Rohypnol is the &quot;date rape drug&quot; because it is
	both odorless and tasteless, so it is easy to slip into a drink without your
	noticing.</p>

  <div id="dateRape__protect"><hr/>
    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">How to Protect Yourself</span></b>
    <hr> <p> Never trust someone you just met to get a drink for you.&nbsp; Always go to the bar yourself and watch carefully as your
	drink is made.</p>
	<p>Do not put down a drink and walk away, even to go to the bathroom, if you want to
	continue drinking it later.</p>
	<p>If you are standing in a crowd, hold the glass with your hand over the top so no
	one can have access to it without your noticing.</p>

  <div id="dateRape__slipped"><hr/>
    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">How to Know if You've Been Slipped a Drug</span></b>
    <hr> <p>Mostof the time you will not know until it's too late.&nbsp; About ten minutes after ingesting the drug, you may feel
	dizzy and disoriented, simultaneously too hot and too cold, or nauseated.&nbsp; You may experience difficulty speaking
	and moving, and then pass out.&nbsp;
	Such victims have no memories of what happened while under the drug's
	influence.</p>
	<p>The best action to take if you begin to notice these symptoms in yourself is to
	find a friend or call 911 immediately.</p>

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">What to Do if You are the Victim of Date Rape</span></b>
    <hr> <p><b> GET HELP.</b></p>
	<p> Phone the police, a friend, a rape crisis center or a relative.</p>
	<p> Don't isolate yourself, feel guilty, or attempt to forget what happened.</p>
	<p>Rape is a crime.&nbsp; Often, the only
	evidence you have is on your body.&nbsp;
	Therefore, it is important that no matter how dirty you feel, do not
	shower or change your clothes until you have talked to the police or a rape
	counselor.</p>
	<p><b>If your friend is the victim of date rape:</b></p>
	<p> Encourage her to talk about what happened and convince her to seek professional
	help.&nbsp; Believe what she says and convince her that you know it's not her fault.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may be tempted to forget about it if she want to, but these crimes affect how we think about ourselves and how we approach
	relationships with others.&nbsp; In the long run, it is more harmful to pretend it never happened than to make him pay for violating her and not respecting her wishes.</p>
	<p>Be smart.&nbsp; Do not put yourself in a situation that you are not comfortable with.&nbsp; Pay attention to signals he puts out
	about his values and views of women.&nbsp; If you get the sense that he is not listening to you, taking what you
	say to heart, or if he makes degrading comments to you, leave!&nbsp; Find an excuse to leave the party, end
	the date early, or whatever else it takes to get you out of the situation.</p>
[ <a href="#dateRape__top">To Top</a> ]  </div>
  <div id="dateRape__remember"><hr/>
    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Tips to Remember</span></b>
    <hr> <p>Always bring enough cash with you so that you can take a taxi or subway home if you
	need to.</p>

	<p>Never rely on him completely--be self-sufficient and he will know that you mean
	business.</p>

	<p>Be aware of your surroundings.&nbsp; If you have been drinking, do not leave the party to be alone.</p>

	<p> Make yourself clearly understood from the start.&nbsp; Do not lead him into thinking that you will sleep with him, unless you plan to.&nbsp; Some men will take a &quot;yes&quot; early on in the date as meaning &quot;yes&quot; later,
	even if you have changed your mind.</p>

	<p><b>Trust your gut feelings.&nbsp; If it walks
	like a duck, talks like a duck and smells like a duck, then it's a duck.</b></p>
