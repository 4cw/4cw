    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Introduction</span></b>
    <hr>  <P>Many women face body image issues at some point throughout their
      lives.  This is a normal part of development and is often influenced
      by friends, family, romantic partners, society, and the media.  In
      addition, many women are or have been on a diet and try to control their
      weight in a variety of ways.  </p>

      Eating disorders have beome common in America - over 7 million people
      have them.  More than ninety percent of those with eating disorders
      are women.  Furthermore, the number of American women affected by
      eating disorders has doubled to at least five million in the past three
      decades.<a href="bulimia.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=

      facing young women today.<a href="bulimia.html#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=
    ""><sup>[2]</sup></a> This fact sheet focuses on bulimia
      nervosa and contains information that should help clarify what it is, as
      well as make suggestions on what to do if you or someone you know is
      dealing with an eating disorder.

      <P>Bulimia nervosa is characterized by self-perpetuating and
      self-defeating cycles of binge eating and purging.<a href="bulimia.html#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=
    ""><sup>[3]</sup></a> Women who suffer from bulimia
      nervosa follow a routine of secretive, uncontrolled or binge eating
      (ingesting an abnormally large amount of food within a set period of time)
      followed by behaviors to rid the body of the food consumed.  This
      includes self-induced vomiting and/or the misuse of laxatives, diet pills,
      diuretics (water pills), excessive exercise or fasting.<a href="bulimia.html#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Causes of Bulimia Nervosa</span></b>
    <hr>
      <P>No exact cause of bulimia has been found, however there are some common
      characteristics of women with eating disorders.  These include low
      self-esteem, feelings of helplessness, and fear of becoming fat.</p>
      <P>Eating disorders appear to run in families, with female relatives most
      often affected.  There is also growing evidence that a girl�s
      immediate social environment, including her family and friends, can
      emphasize the importance of thinness and weight control - leading to body
      image issues.  Therefore, women who are surrounded by the attitude
      that it is important to be thin may develop bulimia in order to deal with
      self-esteem issues associated with food and eating.</p>
      <P>Recent studies have revealed that there may be a connection between
      biological factors associated with clinical depression and the development
      of eating disorders.  Stress hormones such as cortisol are elevated
      in those with eating disorders, while neurotransmitters such as <SPAN
      class=smalldict>SEROTONIN</span> may not be present in the correct
      amounts.</p>
[ <a href="#bulimia__top">To Top</a> ]  </div>
  <div id="bulimia__common"><hr/>
    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Common Symptoms</span></b>
    <hr> <P>People with bulimia are overly concerned with food, body weight, and
      shape.  Because many women with bulimia �binge and purge� in secret
      and maintain normal or above normal body weight, they can often hide the
      disorder from others for years.  Binges can range from once or twice
      a week to several times a day and can be triggered by a variety of
      emotions such as depression, boredom, or anger.  The illness may be
      constant or occasional, with periods of remission alternating with
      recurrences of binge eating.</p>
      <P>Women with bulimia are often characterized as having a hard time
      dealing with and controlling impulses, stress, and anxiety.  Bulimia
      nervosa can and often does occur independently of anorexia nervosa,
      although half of all women with anorexia also develop bulimia.</p>
      <P>A woman with bulimia is usually aware that her eating is out of
      control; she is afraid that she won�t be able to stop eating and is
      terrified of being fat.  She usually feels depressed and guilty after
      a binge.  These emotions may be difficult for women suffering from
      bulimia to admit to themselves because of the stigma that is often
      associated with bulimia and fears of becoming overweight, but it is
      important to note that addressing these feelings may be the first step to
      recovery.</p>
      <P>Since women with bulimia are often of average weight, friends and
      family should pay particular attention to pick up the sometimes subtle
      symptoms of bulimia nervosa.<a href="bulimia.html#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Signs and Signals</span></b>
    <hr>       <P>The following warning signs may help identify someone suffering from
      bulimia.  It is important for people to be aware of these behaviors
      in themselves and in others you they care about in order to identify a
      friend or loved one who needs help.  Bulimia is often wrapped up with
      guilt and secrecy, so be sensitive when you address the issue of a
      possible eating disorder in someone that you care about.  Signs
      include:</p>
      <UL>
        <LI>Becoming very secretive about food</li>
        <LI>Spending a lot of time thinking about and planning the next binge</li>
        <LI>Taking repeated trips to the bathroom, particularly after eating</li>
        <LI>Stealing food or hoarding it in strange places</li>

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Complications</span></b>
    <hr> <P>Many of the medical complications associated with <SPAN
      class=smalldict>BULIMIA NERVOSA</span> result from electrolyte imbalances
      and repeated purging behaviors. Women with bulimia nervosa can severely
      damage their bodies by frequent binge eating and purging.  In some
      cases, binge eating causes the stomach to rupture. Loss of potassium due
      to vomiting, for example, can damage the heart muscle, and increases the
      risk for cardiac arrest.  </p>
      <P>Repeated vomiting can also cause inflammation of the esophagus; the
      stomach acid wears down the outer layer of teeth and can also cause
      scarring on the backs of hands if fingers are pushed down the throat to
      induce vomiting.  Also, stomach acid may irritate the esophagus and
      glands near the cheeks.  Bulimia may lead to irregular menstrual
      periods due to irregular caloric intake and interest in sex may
      diminish.  Some individuals with bulimia also struggle with
      addictions such as drugs, alcohol, and compulsive stealing.  Some
      people with bulimia suffer from clinical depression, anxiety,
      obsessive-compulsive disorder and other mental disorders. Link to

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Treatment</span></b>
    <hr>  <P>Eating disorders can be treated and a healthy weight restored. The
      sooner these disorders are diagnosed and treated, the better the outcomes
      are likely to be. Because of their complexity, eating disorders require a
      comprehensive treatment plan involving medical care and monitoring,
      psychosocial interventions, nutritional counseling and, when appropriate,
      medication management. At the time of diagnosis, the clinician must
      determine whether the person is in immediate danger and requires
      hospitalization.</p>
      <P>The primary goal of treatment for bulimia is to reduce or eliminate
      binge eating and purging behavior. To this end, nutritional
      rehabilitation, psychosocial intervention, and medication management
      strategies are often used. It is important to establish a pattern of
      regular, non-binge meals, improve attitudes related to the eating
      disorder, encourage a healthy, but not excessive, exercise, and resolve
      co-occurring conditions such as mood or anxiety disorders are among the
      specific aims of these strategies. Individual psychotherapy, group
      psychotherapy, and family or marital therapy have been reported to be
      effective. Specific medications, primarily antidepressants such as the
      selective <SPAN class=smalldict>SEROTONIN</span> reuptake inhibitors
      (SSRIs), have been found helpful for people with bulimia, particularly in
      those with significant symptoms of depression or anxiety, or who have not
      responded adequately to psychosocial treatment alone. These medications
      also may help prevent relapse. </p>
      <P> </p>
      <P>People with eating disorders often do not recognize or admit that they
      are ill. As a result, they may strongly resist getting and staying in
      treatment. Family members or other trusted individuals can be helpful in
      ensuring that the person with an eating disorder receives needed care and
      rehabilitation. For some people, treatment may be long
      term.</p><a href="bulimia.html#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Seeking help for yourself or someone that you care about</span></b>
    <hr> <P>Many women suffering from bulimia are ashamed of their behavior and
      often do not seek kelp until their 30s or 40s.<a href="bulimia.html#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=
    ""><sup>[10]</sup></a>  Furthermore, because of the secretive habits
      of many individuals with eating disorders, their conditions may go
      undiagnosed for long periods of time.<a href="bulimia.html#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=
    ""><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>
      <P>This is unfortunate because eating disorders are most successfully
      treated when diagnosed early.  The longer abnormal eating behaviors
      persist, the more difficult it is to overcome the disorder and its effects
      on the body.  In some cases, long-term treatment and hospitalization
      is required.  Families and friends offering support and encouragement
      can play an important role in the success of the treatment program.<a href="bulimia.html#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=
    ""><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>
      <P>If you think that you have <SPAN class=smalldict>BULIMIA NERVOSA</span>
      or have a friend with some of the previously described symptoms, it is
      important to seek help.  For help, go to a physician, nutritionist,
      campus health center, or another professional with expertise in diagnosing
      eating disorders.  Your college or university may have an
      organization that specifically on providing support and help for women
      with eating disorders.  Remember that although asking for help can be
      very difficult, it is necessary to do so in order to get better.</p>
