    <hr> <P>Eating is controlled by many factors, including appetite, food
	      availability, family, peer and cultural practices.&nbsp; Dieting to a body
	      weight leaner than needed for your health is highly promoted by current
	      fashion trends, sales campaigns for special foods, and even by peer
	      pressure on our own campuses.</p>
	      <P>Approximately 1-5% of women will develop an eating disorder.&nbsp;
	      Eating disorders involve serious disturbances in eating behavior, such as
	      extreme and unhealthy reduction of food intake or severe overeating, as
	      well as feelings of distress or concern about body shape or weight.&nbsp;
	      Researchers are investigating how and why initially voluntary actions,
	      such as eating smaller or larger amounts of food than usual, at some point
	      move beyond our control in some of us.&nbsp;</p>
	      <P>Eating disorders are not due to a failure in our own will or behavior,
	      rather, they are real, treatable medical illnesses in which certain
	      altered eating patterns seem to take on a life of their own.&nbsp; Two
	      main types of eating disorders are anorexia nervosa and <SPAN
	      class=smalldict>BULIMIA NERVOSA</SPAN> link to this infosheet.&nbsp;
	      Eating disorders often develop during adolescence or early adulthood (like
	      during college), but research has shown that they can occur in children as
	      well as older adults, too.<a href="anorexia.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">What is anorexia nervosa?</span></b>
    <hr> <P>People who intentionally starve themselves or severely restrict their
	      food intake suffer from an eating disorder called anorexia nervosa. &nbsp;
	      The word anorexia literally means loss of appetite and approximately 1-2%
	      of women will be affected by this disorder.&nbsp; About half of all
	      anorexics display symptoms of bulimia. The disorder, which usually begins
	      in young people, mostly females, around the time or puberty, involves
	      extreme weight loss -- at least 15 percent below a young womanï¿½s normal
	      body weight. Those experiencing anorexia nervosa also have an intense fear
	      of becoming fat, even though they are underweight. Many people with the
	      anorexia look emaciated but are convinced that they are overweight.
	      Sometimes they must be hospitalized to prevent starvation, yet they often
	      continue to deny the condition. Food and weight become obsessions. For
	      some women, the compulsiveness shows up in strange eating rituals or the
	      refusal to eat in front of others. It is not uncommon for women with
	      anorexia to collect recipes and prepare lavish gourmet feasts for family
	      and friends, but not partake in the meals themselves. Often they will
	      maintain rigid exercise routines to keep off the weight. Knowing about
	      anorexia is especially important for college-age women since ninety
	      percent of all anorexics are women.</P>

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">What are the causes of anorexia nervosa?</span></b>
    <hr>       <P>The exact cause of <SPAN class=smalldict>ANOREXIA NERVOSA</SPAN>
	      remains unknown, but it is thought to be linked to a combination of
	      biological, psychological and environmental factors.&nbsp; Eating
	      disorders frequently co-occur with other psychiatric disorders like
	      depression.</P>
	      <P>Additionally, scientists have found that anorexia and other eating
	      disorders seem to run in families, especially in females.&nbsp; For
	      example, a woman has a 10 to 20 times greater risk of developing an eating
	      disorder if she has a sibling with the disease.<a href="anorexia.html#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=
    ""><sup>[2]</sup></a> This may suggest a role for our
	      genes in giving some of us a predisposition to eating disorders.&nbsp;
	      Biological characteristics of women with anorexia have shown these women
	      to have lower levels of the brain chemicals seratonin and
	      norepinepherine.<a href="anorexia.html#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=
    ""><sup>[3]</sup></a> Altered levels of these chemicals
	      have also been noticed in people suffering from
	      depression.&nbsp;</P>

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Symptoms of Anorexia Nervosa</span></b>
    <hr> <P>People with anorexia may believe that they would be happier and more
	      successful if they were thin; a notion that many college-women are all too
	      familiar with.&nbsp; Anorexics tend to be perfectionists. They want
	      everything in their lives to be perfect. People suffering from this
	      illness are typically good students and are involved in many school and
	      community activities. They tend to blame themselves if things in their
	      life are less than perfect. Many anorexics suffer from errors in thinking
	      or perceptions. They incorrectly believe they need to lose weight to find
	      happiness. Common in anorexics is their distorted view of their own body.
	      Others have had difficulties in relationships and manifest these problems
	      through their eating habits. Anorexia can also be the delayed result of
	      unresolved conflicts or painful experiences from
	      childhood.</P>

  <div id="anorexia__problems"><hr/>
    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">What problems are associated with anorexia?</span></b>
    <hr> <P>There are many health consequences of anorexia nervosa. Women with
	      anorexia usually stop having menstrual periods; this is a condition called
	      amenorrhea. Anorexia may lead to dry skin and thinning hair. Anorexics may
	      grow fine hair all over their body as a natural defense mechanism against
	      extreme weight loss and the accompanying drop in body temperature. People
	      suffering from anorexia may feel cold and are easily susceptible to
	      illness. Mood swings often occur. The National Institute of Mental Health
	      estimates that one in ten people with anorexia dies from starvation,
	      suicide or medical complications like heart attacks or kidney failure.
	      Physical problems also include anemia, heart palpitations, bone loss,
	      tooth decay, as well as inflammation of the esophagus.</P>

  <div id="anorexia__treatment"><hr/>
    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">What is the treatment for anorexia?</span></b>
    <hr> <P>Eating disorders can be treated and a healthy weight restored.&nbsp;
	      Anorexia is a mental problem manifested in a physical form and demands
	      immediate medical attention. The sooner the condition is diagnosed and
	      treated, the better the outcomes are likely to be.&nbsp; Treatment for any
	      eating disorder should include a mental health professional as well as a
	      primary health care physician, and nutrition experts. Essential components
	      of successful treatments are ongoing medical care, regular psychotherapy,
	      nutritional counseling, and possibly medication. Some eating disorders may
	      be treated with antidepressants; however, they appear to be less effective
	      for anorexia nervosa. Physicians help monitor bone density loss and can
	      detect heart rhythm disturbances. Psychologists and psychiatrists help
	      patients identify the important emotional issues and replace destructive
	      thoughts and behaviors with more positive ones. Support groups also play a
	      role in treating anorexia. Often groups of patients will meet weekly to
	      discuss their fears and help each other recover. Most cases of anorexia
	      can be treated successfully, but not instantly. For many patients,
	      treatments may need to be long-term. Luckily, though, most of the health
	      effects of anorexia can be reversed once the patient gains weight.</P>
	      <P>The specific treatment program for anorexia involves three main
	      phases:<a href="anorexia.html#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=
    ""><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>
		<ol>
		<li>restoring weight loss that resulted from severe dieting and purging.</li> &nbsp;
	      	<li> Treating psychological disturbances such as distortion of body image, low self-esteem, and interpersonal conflicts,
	      and</li>
		<li> achieving long-term remission and rehabilitation, or full recovery.</li>
		</ol>
	      <P>Early diagnosis and treatment increases the chances for
	      success.&nbsp; Use of psychotropic medication should only be used after
	      weight gain has begun.&nbsp; Certain serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
	      have been shown to be useful in helping patients maintain weight and
	      controlling mood and anxiety problems associated with
	      anorexia.</P>

  <div id="anorexia__help"><hr/>
    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">How can family and friends help?</span></b>
    <hr> <P>If you think a friend or family member has anorexia, talk with them
      about the behavior that you observed in a caring, nonjudgmental way and
      encourage the person to get medical help. If you think you have anorexia,
      remember that you are not alone and that this is a health problem that
      requires professional help. As a first step, talk to your parents,
      physician, religious counselor, or campus health professional.</p>
