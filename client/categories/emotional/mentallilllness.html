      <b>What is Mental Illness?</b>
      <a href="mentallillness___ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a><hr/>

      <p>One out of four Americans has a mental illness during any
      given year.? A mental illness is a disease that causes
      mild to severe disturbances in thought and/or behavior,
      making it difficult to cope with life's ordinary
      demands and routines.?</p>
 	<p>There are more than 200 types of mental illnesses. Some of
      the more common disorders are:
		<ul>

      <li><a href="depression.html">Depression</a> </li>
      <li>Bipolar disorder</li>

      <li>Dementia</li>

      <li>Schizophrenia</li>

      <li>Anxiety disorders, such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</li>
		</ul> </p>

      <p>Symptoms may include changes in mood, personality, thought
      patterns, personal habits and/or social withdrawal.</p>

      <p>Mental illnesses may be caused by a reaction to
      environmental stresses, genetic factors, biochemical
      imbalances, or a combination of these. With <b>proper
      care</b> and <b>treatment</b> most people with a mental
      illness or emotional disorder can be helped.</p>

      <b>How to Cope</b><hr />

      <p>Dealing with a family member with a mental illness can be
      both hard and frustrating.? What you may think is easy
      and straightforward isn't so for your family member,
      because the illness impairs their ability to deal with these
      situations.? Take the time to educate yourself about
      your family member's illness and its treatment.?
      It's normal to not understand exactly what your family
      member is going through.</p>

      <p>Patience and understanding are your greatest tools.?
      Realize that a mental illness can alter moods, attitudes, and
      habits.? Understand that whoever is suffering from this
      illness can probably see these changes too, and are probably
      scared by his or her inability to control him/herself.?
      Provide your family member with a safe environment so he or
      she won't be judged or condemned.? Also,
      encourage your family member to stay on the treatment.?
      Remember -- your job is to be supportive.? If you do not
      know how to handle a situation talk to your own doctor or
      campus health professional for help.? You may, also,
      want to join a support group for family members of people
      with mental disorders.?</p>
