        <p>We all experience emotional downs at times; it's very
        common. But, these times of feeling blue should not
        interfere with your ability to function, nor should they
        linger for an abnormally long period of time.&nbsp; If you
        are experiencing persistent sadness that's interfering
        with school, work, and/or relationships, you might be
        suffering from a common, serious medical illness called
        <i>depression</i>. Many women may have their first
        episode of depression during their college years.</p>

        <p>Depression is a medical disorder, just like diabetes, high
        blood pressure, and heart disease, that day after day affects
        your thoughts, feelings, physical health, and behavior.
        Depression is not just "feeling blue" or "down in the dumps."
        <a href="depression___ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=
      ""><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

        <p>About 1 in 20 Americans (over 11 million people) suffer
        from clinical depression each year.
        <a href="depression___ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=
      ""><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

        <p>Depression is a pervasive, impairing illness that affects
        women at roughly twice the rate of men.&nbsp; In fact, recent
        studies suggest that one fifth of all women will develop clinical
        depression at some point over the course of their lives.
        <a href="depression___ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=
      ""><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>



        <p>Depression presents itself differently in different
        people; they experience different symptoms that may vary in
        severity and duration.</p>

        <p>Having some depressive symptoms does not mean a person is
        clinically depressed. For example, it is not unusual for
        those who have lost a loved one to feel sad, helpless, and
        disinterested in regular activities. Only when these symptoms
        persist for an unusually long time is there reason to suspect
        that grief has become a depressive illness.</p>

        <p>Similarly, living with the stress of a college workload,
        grades, social pressures or family problems may cause
        irritability, sadness, and "the blues." Up to a point, such
        feelings are simply a part of human experience. But when
        these feelings increase in duration and intensity and start
        affecting your ability to function at school and participate
        in relationships, what started as a temporary mood problem
        may have become a clinical illness.&nbsp; It is important to
        remember that depression is a <i>medical illness</i> that
        often occurs even when life is going well.&nbsp;</p>

      <hr>

        <p>Depression may be triggered by as little as one or a
        combination of the following factors:
        	<ul>
  		  <li>Family history and genetics</li>

  		  <li>Biochemical factors</li>

  		  <li>Various mental disorders</li>

  		  <li>Certain medicines</li>

  		  <li>Acute or chronic physical ailments</li>

  		  <li>Drugs or alcohol</li>

  		  <li>Life conditions, such as extreme stress, grief, or
  		  relationship problems</li>
  		</ul></p>
        <p><b><i>Genetic factors</i></b> may predispose an individual
        to develop depression.&nbsp; A family history of the illness
        may indicate that there is a biological vulnerability that
        has been inherited.&nbsp; However, not everybody with a
        family history of depression will develop the illness. And
        clinical depression can occur in people who have no family
        history of the illness.</p>

        <p>Alterations in brain chemicals are significant factors in
        depression, resulting in mood, appetite, and sleep pattern
        changes.</p>

        <p>Certain attributes such as having a low self-esteem, a
        pessimistic view of life, a sense of having little control over
        one's own life are key symptoms as well; general <b><i>negative
        thinking</i></b> leads people with these attributes to have a
        higher rate of depression than others without these
        characteristics.&nbsp; Furthermore, people with the tendency
        to excessively worry are also at a heightened risk of
        developing the illness.</p>

        <p>While fun, being in college can be extremely
        stressful.&nbsp; <b><i>Stress</i></b> and every day life
        "issues" can trigger mood changes.&nbsp; When
        these changes persist, depression may occur.&nbsp; Dealing
        with the stress of a college work load, relationships, major
        life changes, financial worries, a job, possibly single
        parenthood, a physical illness, a significant loss and many
        other various stressful events all lead women to an immense
        amount of stress that may trigger the onset of
        depression.&nbsp; You must remember that you're not
        alone.&nbsp; Depression affects more of us than you
        think.</p>

        <p>Your college may provide many resources to help students
        deal with the stresses of college life.&nbsp; Take advantage
        of them; they're there for <b>you!!!</b></p>

      <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Women and Depression; How We're Different</span></b>
      <hr>

        <p>Women are at a higher risk for developing depression over
        their lifetime.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Studies have shown that before adolescence there is little
        difference in the rate of depression between boys and
        girls.
        <a href="depression___ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=
      ""><sup>[6]</sup></a>
        Between the ages of 11 and 13, there is a significant rise in
        depression rates for girls, eventually causing females to be
        twice as likely to have experienced a major depressive
        episode by the age of 15 as males.
        <a href="depression___ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=
      ""><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

        <p>This rise is observed at a time when roles and
        expectations begin to be more strongly emphasized at the same
        time as hormonal changes occur with the onset of
        puberty.&nbsp; This may cause additional stresses for females
        in that age group.&nbsp; Such stresses include:
        <a href="depression___ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=
      ""><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

  		<ul>
  		  <li>Forming an identity</li>

  		  <li>Emerging sexuality</li>

  		  <li>Separating from parents</li>

  		  <li>Making decisions for the first time</li>

  		  <li>Dealing with intellectual changes</li>

  		  <li>Hormonal changes</li>

  		  <li>Physical changes</li>
  		</ul>
        <p>Additionally, college women have to deal with other
        stresses that include sexual activity, and competition issues
        with both men and other women.&nbsp; The college experience
        is the time one discovers oneself emotionally, which is a
        stressful yet defining part of life.</p>

        <p>
        <a href="depression___ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=
      ""><sup>[9]</sup></a>
        Another
        major factor causing certain people, especially women, to be
        more highly predisposed to the illness is experiences of
        having been molested as children.&nbsp; Similarly, women who
        have been raped at any point in their lives have a higher
        chance of developing depression during their lifetime.&nbsp;
        Incidents of rape are much more prevalent in females than in
        males, which is consistent with the subsequent depressive
        illnesses that more women eventually experience.&nbsp;
        Furthermore, women who experience other commonly occurring
        forms of abuse such as physical abuse, sexual harassment, and
        psychological abuse may also experience higher rates of
        depression.&nbsp; Such abuse causes women to think and feel
        negatively about themselves, often leading to social
        isolation and, in some, eventually depression.</p>

        <p>People who have major depressive disorder have a number of
        psychological and physiological symptoms nearly every day,
        all day, for at least 2 weeks.&nbsp; A combination of 3-5 of
        the following symptoms may indicate the presence of

          <ul type="square">
            <li>Loss of interest in things you generally enjoy</li>

            <li>Feeling slowed down or restless</li>

            <li>Feeling worthless or guilty</li>

            <li>Experiencing an increase or decrease in appetite or

        <p>Episodes of depression can occur once, twice, or several

        <p>Alcohol and other substance abuse, or an addiction, often
        coexists with depression.</p>

        <p>Suicidal thoughts and behaviors may occur when a person is
        severely depressed.&nbsp; These tendencies may lead someone to
        commit an irreversible action.&nbsp; If you're feeling suicidal,
        tell a trusted friend, teacher, staff member, family member,
        or health care professional; tell anybody you trust.&nbsp; Ask
        this person to help you get professional help and medical

      <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Treatment for Clinical Depression</span></b>
      <hr>

        <p>You should know that <i>depression is a very treatable illness</i>.</p>

        <p>One major aspect of depression is the hopelessness that
        accompanies it, including the notion that some people hear
        that the condition is untreatable and "will never go away."</p>

        <p>Treatment cannot begin without an appropriate
        diagnosis.&nbsp; A thorough physical examination should be
        conducted to rule out any physical illnesses that may produce
        depressive symptoms.&nbsp; You should tell your doctor about
        all medications (both prescription and over-the-counter), as
        they may be the cause of depressive symptoms. Also, tell your
        doctor about any alcohol or drug use and any dietary
        supplements that you are taking.&nbsp; Once the physical
        examination has concluded and a physical cause of the disease
        has been ruled out, you should turn to psychological evaluation;
        this can be conducted by the same physician or a mental
        health professional.</p>

        <p>Early treatment of depression leads to more effective and
        longer-lasting results.</p>

        <p>Common treatments for depression include one or a
        combination of the following, depending on the nature and
        severity of the condition:</p>

  		<ul>
  		  <li>Psychotherapy</li>

  		  <li>Medications (usually antidepressants)</li>

  		  <li>A combination of Medication and Psychotherapy</li>

  		  <li>Electroconvulsive therapy in treatment-resistant severe
  		  depression</li>
  		</ul>

        <p>Of course, treatment will not eliminate life's inevitable
        stresses and ups and downs. But it can greatly enhance a
        person's ability to manage school, work and relationship
        challenges and lead to greater enjoyment of life.</p>

      ""><sup>[12]</sup></a></span></b>
      <hr>



        <p>In mild to moderate cases of depression, psychotherapy is
        an important treatment option. Some short-term (10-20 week)
        therapies have been very effective against several types of
        depression. The different types of psychotherapy include
        "talking" therapies and "behavioral"
        treatments.&nbsp; "Talking" therapies help
        patients gain insight into their problems and resolve them through
        verbal give-and-take sessions with a therapist.
        "Behavioral" treatments help patients learn new
        behaviors that lead to more satisfaction in life and to an
        "unlearning" of counter-productive behaviors. Research has
        shown that two short-term psychotherapies, interpersonal and
        cognitive-behavioral, are helpful against some types of
        depression. Interpersonal therapy works to change
        interpersonal relationships that cause or exacerbate
        depression. Cognitive-behavioral therapy helps change
        negative styles of thinking and behaving that may contribute
        to depression.</p>

        <p><b><i>Antidepressants</i></b></p>

        <a href="depression___ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=
      ""><sup>[13]</sup></a>

        <p>Antidepressants act on different chemical pathways in our
        brain that affect our mood.</p>

        <p>Antidepressants are non habit-forming medications.</p>

        <p>Improvement can be seen as early as the first few weeks of
        medication.&nbsp; Typically, these medications need to be
        taken regularly for 4-8 weeks until their full effects
        are experienced.&nbsp; A relapse may be prevented by staying
        on the medication for about a year under a doctor's
        supervision.&nbsp; For some people who have experienced several
        episodes of depression, they may need to stay on medication
        indefinitely to improve their mood, much in the same way as
        people with <span class=smalldict>DIABETES</span>
        take regular medications to treat their illness.</p>

        <p>You should inform your doctor of any other prescriptions,
        over-the-counter medications, or diet supplements you
        may be taking that may affect the potency of the medication
        or result in interactions causing potentially harmful side
        effects.&nbsp; As with all medications, be extra
        cautious if you're pregnant or suspect you might be
        pregnant.</p>

      <hr>

        <p>For individuals whose depression is severe or life
        threatening or for those who cannot take antidepressant
        medication, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be useful.
        This is particularly true for patients with:</p>
  	<ul>
        <li>Extreme suicide risk</li>

        <li>Severe agitation</li>

        <li>Psychotic thinking</li>

        <li>Severe weight loss</li>

        <li>Physical debilitation as a result of physical illness</li>
  	</ul>
        <p>A muscle relaxant is given before treatment, which is done
        under brief anesthesia. Electrodes are placed at precise
        locations on the head to deliver electrical impulses. The
        person receiving ECT does not consciously experience the
        electrical stimulus. At least several sessions of ECT are
        required for full therapeutic benefit.</p>

        can do to help yourself is recognize that these negative
        feelings are part of the depression and will fade as
        treatment begins to take effect.</p>

        <p>Some people find that some of the following strategies
        will help you get through depression:</p>
  		<ul>
  		  <li>Partaking in activities that make you feel better</li>

  		  <li>Exercising</li>

  		  <li>Joining a support group</li>

  		  <li>Spending time with other people</li>
  		</ul>
        <p>Remember not to expect too much from yourself right away;
        you're only human and feeling better takes time!</p>

      <hr>

        <p>One of the most important things to remember
        when experiencing a recurrent episode of depression is that
        depression is treatable; you've gotten through it before,
        you'll get through it this time!&nbsp; You must
        remember the methods you used that were most helpful with
        your previous treatment, including seeking help again.&nbsp;
        The sooner the recurrence is treated, the shorter its
        duration will be.</p>

        <p>As in many other illnesses, depression is a recurrent
        disease.&nbsp; The best way to prevent such a recurrence is
        continuation of the treatment that was successful with the
        initial episode, which is most often the same dose of
        antidepressant medication that was initially prescribed. For
        patients not taking antidepressants for their depression,
        monthly interpersonal psychotherapy help can prevent
        recurrent episodes.</p>
