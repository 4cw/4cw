    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Introduction</span></b>
    <hr> <p>Worries, doubts, and personal rituals are all common in
      everyday life.&nbsp; However, when they become excessive to
      point of interfering with daily life then a diagnosis of
      Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) may be made by a medical
      professional. Some common examples of behaviors
      characteristic of OCD include hours of hand washing, or a
      need to check-up on things repeatedly.&nbsp; You may also be
      preoccupied by thoughts of violence and fear that you will
      harm people close to you.&nbsp; The disturbing thoughts and
      images, which are typical characteristics of OCD, are called
      obsessions, and the rituals that are performed to try and
      prevent or dispel them are called compulsions.&nbsp; Although
      a lot of healthy people can identify with having some of the
      symptoms of OCD, the condition is recognized when such
      activities interfere with daily life.&nbsp; People with OCD
      often describe their symptoms as feeling like mental hiccups
      that won't go away.&nbsp; OCD is a medical brain disorder
      that causes problems in information processing resulting in
      symptoms that may include those described above.&nbsp;
      Approximately 2% of Americans, or about 3.3 million people,
      suffer from OCD each year, so you are not alone.&nbsp; This
      disorder affects both men and women equally and symptoms
      usually become apparent during adolescence or early
      childhood.<a href="ocd___ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">What causes OCD?</span></b>
    <hr> <p>There is no single, proven cause of OCD, but there is
      growing evidence that OCD represents abnormal functioning of
      brain circuitry.&nbsp; OCD is not caused by family problems
      or attitudes learned in childhood, nor is it your fault that
      you suffer from OCD. &nbsp;</p>

      <p>Research suggests that OCD involves problems with
      communication different parts of the brain. These brain
      structures use the chemical messenger <span class=smalldict>SEROTONIN</span>. It is
      believed that insufficient levels of <span class=smalldict>SEROTONIN</span> are
      prominently involved in OCD. Drugs that increase the brain
      concentration of <span class=smalldict>SEROTONIN</span> often help improve
      symptoms.&nbsp; Although it seems clear that reduced levels
      of <span class=smalldict>SEROTONIN</span> play a role in OCD, there is no
      laboratory test for OCD; the diagnosis is made based on an
      assessment of the person's symptoms.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>There are different risk factors for OCD as well:</p>

      <p>Childhood-onset OCD tends to run in families.</p>

      <p>When a parent has OCD, there is a slightly increased risk
      that a child will develop the disease, although the risk is
      still low.</p>

      <p>When OCD runs in families, specific symptoms are not
      inherited even if the disease is transmitted.</p>

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">What are some of the symptoms of OCD?</span></b>
    <hr> <p>Symptoms and behaviors associated with OCD are varied.
      Common symptoms include generally unwanted behaviors and/or
      thoughts that occur very frequently (several times a
      day).&nbsp; OCD usually involves having both
      <b>obsessions</b> and <b>compulsions</b>, though a person
      with OCD may sometimes have only one or the other.</p>

      <p><b>Obsessions</b> are thoughts, images, or impulses that
      occur over and over again and feel out of control. The person
      does not want to have these ideas, finds them disturbing and
      intrusive, and usually recognizes that they don't really make
      sense.&nbsp; People with OCD typically try to make their
      obsessions go away by performing compulsions<b>.</b></p>

      <p><b>Compulsions</b> are acts the person performs over and
      over again, often according to certain "rules." People with
      an obsession about contamination may wash constantly to the
      point that their hands become raw and inflamed.&nbsp; Unlike
      compulsive drinking or gambling, OCD compulsions do not give
      the person pleasure. Rather, the rituals are performed to
      obtain relief from the discomfort caused by the
      obsessions.</p>

      <p>Some of symptoms and behaviors may include, but are not
      limited to:</p>

      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Checking things repeatedly, such as doors, locks,
        stoves, etc.</li>

        <li>Constant counting or preoccupation with symmetry.</li>

        <li>"Having" to do things a certain number of times. An
        example of this would be taking a shower and "having" to
        wash the left foot three times.</li>

        <li>Obsessively arranging things in an extremely orderly
        fashion.</li>

        <li>Pictures, words or images that "pop" into one's head
        and won't go away -- usually of a disturbing nature.</li>

        <li>Nonsensical words or phrases repeated in the person's
        mind.</li>

        <li>Hoarding of objects with usually no apparent value. The
        person usually saves such objects under the rationalization
        of "what if I need them someday?" or is just unable to
        decide what to discard.</li>

        <li>Excessive fear of contamination/fear of germs.</li>
      </ul>

  <div id="ocd__treatment"><hr/>
    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">How is OCD treated?</span></b>
    <hr>  <p>The first step in treating OCD is <b>educating</b> the
      patient and family about OCD and its treatment.</p>

      <p>Treatments for OCD include:</p>

      <p><b>Pharmacotherapy</b> - In recent years, clinical trials
      have shown that specific medications are very helpful in the
      treatment of this disorder.&nbsp; Drugs that affect <span class=smalldict>SEROTONIN</span>
      levels can significantly decrease symptoms of OCD.&nbsp;
      These are often classified as SRIs, or <span class=smalldict>SEROTONIN</span> re-uptake
      inhibitors.&nbsp; If a patient does not respond to these,
      however, other treatments are pursued.&nbsp; Additionally, if
      the medication is discontinued, relapse will follow.</p>

      <p><b>Side Effects</b></p>

      <p>In general, the drugs are well tolerated by most people
      with OCD.&nbsp; Some side effects include nervousness,
      insomnia, restlessness, nausea, and diarrhea.&nbsp; All side
      effects depend on the dose of medication and on how long one
      takes it.&nbsp; If side effects greatly interfere with daily
      life, it is important to make sure that the initial dosage of
      medication is small and increased slowly.&nbsp; More severe
      side effects are associated with larger doses and a rapid
      increase in dosage.</p>

      <p><b>Behavior Therapy-</b> Traditional psychotherapy, aimed
      at helping the patient develop insight into the problem, is
      generally not helpful for treating OCD.&nbsp; However, a
      specific behavior therapy approach called "exposure and
      response prevention" is effective for many people with OCD.
      <b>Exposure</b> is based on the fact that anxiety usually
      goes down after enough contact with something feared. Thus,
      people with obsessions about germs are told to hold or remain
      in contact with something that they fear is full of germs
      until their anxiety lessens and disappears altogether.&nbsp;
      Over time, the patient experiences decreased anxiety from
      obsessive thoughts and becomes able to do without the
      compulsive actions.&nbsp; For exposure to be of the most
      help, it needs to be combined with <b>response or ritual
      prevention (RP).</b> In RP, the person's rituals or avoidance
      behaviors are blocked. For example, those with excessive
      worries about germs must not only stay in contact with
      <i>"germy things,"</i> but must also refrain from ritualized
      washing.</p>

      <p><b>Side Effects</b></p>

      <p>People react differently to behavior therapy, just as they
      do to medication.&nbsp; "Exposure and response prevention" is
      relatively free of side effects, but all patients will
      experience some anxiety during treatment.</p>

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Some frequently asked questions</span></b>
    <hr> <b>If I have any of the &ldquo;common&rdquo; symptoms or
      behaviors, does it mean that I have OCD?</b>

      <blockquote>That depends upon the degree in which the symptoms or
      behaviors interfere with your thinking, reasoning, and/or
      life functioning. If you feel you have any of these symptoms
      or symptoms of a similar nature, consult a health
      professional experienced with OCD and discuss your
      symptoms.</blockquote>

      <b>Can People with OCD have other Illnesses?</b>

      <blockquote>OCD is sometimes accompanied by depression, eating
      disorders, substance abuse, attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD), or other anxiety disorders.&nbsp; When a
      person also has other disorders, OCD is often more difficult
      to diagnose and treat.&nbsp; Persons with OCD use different
      brain circuitry in performing a cognitive task than people
      without the disorder.</blockquote>

      <b>Is OCD considered to be an anxiety disorder?</b>

      <blockquote>Yes. The obsessions cause anxiety, which results in a
      need to perform compulsions which provides temporary
      relief.</blockquote>

      <b>Why doesn't an individual with OCD "just stop" their
      behavior?</b>

      <blockquote>Most truly wish they could. Probably the biggest reason
      why they do not "just stop" is anxiety. The person with OCD
      suffers intense anxiety over whatever their symptoms focus
      upon. They want to "make sure" that whatever they are
      focusing upon is taken care of.&nbsp; They can't just stop
      the behavior.</blockquote>

      <b>Are there any other disorders related to OCD?</b>

      <blockquote>Tourette's syndrome link to dictionary is related to OCD,
      and some people have both disorders. Several other disorders
      appear similar to OCD, including Body Dysmorphic dictionary
      Disorder (BDD), Trichotillomania (hair pulling), and impulse
      control disorders dictionary, but it is not clear whether or
      not these illnesses are truly related to OCD. Other
      disorders, such as major depression, social phobia, and panic
      disorder are more common in people with OCD.&nbsp;</blockquote>

      <b>Can stress affect OCD?</b>

      <blockquote>Yes. It is typical to notice a worsening of OCD symptoms
      during stressful periods. Stress does not cause OCD, but a
      stressful event (like the death of a loved one, birth of a
      child, or divorce) may trigger the onset of the disorder or
      exacerbate it.</blockquote>
