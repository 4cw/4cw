    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Introduction</span></b>
    <hr> <p>Going to college for the first time is an exhilarating experience. Your feelings may range from immense excitement to sadness. You will meet new people, and at the same time, say goodbye for a time to some of your closest friends and family. The average first-year student at college is flooded with emotions and feelings, and very often we do not talk about these feelings. It is important to open up dialogue with fellow first year students and with trusted adults so that the transition is less stressful for you.</p>

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">So, you got accepted, now what?</span></b>
    <hr> <p>You received the "big envelope." You know where you are going to school, whether that is 3000 miles away or miles away. You, and most of your high school friends can talk about nothing else other than college, but you are scared of what lies ahead. Suddenly, you are in charge of your life.</p>
	<p>You will be allowed to make decisions that will affect your future. You may not be living with your parents anymore. Or, perhaps you are still living with them, but the rules are much more relaxed and your curfew has been extended or diminished completely. But before you can even leave for school, there are some people you need to say goodbye to.</p>

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Saying Goodbye</span></b>
    <hr>
       <!-- <p>Remember the last night that all
	of your high school friends met to say goodbye before your
	parents sent you off to college. The entire evening, all you
	could talk about was college - what it would be like, who your
	roommates would be, how we would decorate our rooms,
	etc. Towards the end of the night, we were all so excited
	about where we were going, that we somewhat forgot that we
	also had to say goodbye.</p>
       -->

       <p>
        It is true that when you leave your
	high school friends, some things will never be the same. Many
	of you will grow apart; although some may grow closer
	together. Suddenly, the aspects of your friendships that held
	you together in high school no longer exist in college.
        Once you go to college, with some of your friends,
        while you talk very rarely, there will
	always be a special bond  that even 3,000 miles
	cannot break apart, but this may not be the case with other
        friends. The most important thing about saying
	goodbye is to recognize that it is a transition. You are
	leaving some part of yourselves with each other and moving on
	to new roles in the world.</P>

	<p>Saying goodbye to parents for a while is also an emotional
	ride. Realizing that they no longer will enforce rules to the
	same degree can be both exciting and scary. Letting go, from
	both the parent's viewpoint and the student's, is extremely
	difficult. As with saying goodbye to friends, it is important
	to acknowledge the difficulty in the situation, as well as the
	feelings that accompany the farewell. While it may seem as
	though your mother is being annoying when she sets up your
	room, or that your father is driving you crazy with the
	computer, or that your grandmother cannot stop telling you
	about when she was in college, it is important to remember
	that they love you and want the best for you.  Also, remember
	that they too are experiencing feelings of loss as you depart
	for school and their role in parenting no longer remains a
	daily responsibility. Each student's experience is different,
	whether she is living at home, living at school, has both
	parents or has older or younger siblings. Whatever your
	situation may be, keep in mind that the transition is
	difficult for everyone and always keep communication lines
	open between all parties involved.<p>

    <hr> <P>So what is the new first-year to do? Before you leave home, have a plan to implement and a promise or "contract" with yourself to take care  of your health.
	<ul>
	<li>Eat Right and Exercise. </li>
        <li>Don't smoke.</li>
	<li>Get Plenty of Sleep.  </li>
	<li>Don't take drugs unless they are prescribed to you by a doctor.  </li>
	<li>Don't abuse alcohol.  </li>
	<li>Take Time to Relax.  </li>
	<li>Be open to making new friends.  </li>
	<li>Reach out to others  </li>
	<li><B>Learn to Manage Your Time.</b>  Make and follow a daily schedule that includes priority time for classes, reading and writing assignments, exam preparation, meals, exercise, a job, and social activities.  </li>
	<li><b>Assert Yourself.</b>  Clearly communicate what you do and don't want out of dates, party situations, and a roommate.  </li>
	<li><b>Create a Budget.</b> Your income must equal or exceed your expenses.  </li>
	<li><B>Get Involved.</b>  Participate in clubs and organizations, campus events, intramural, and religious groups.  </li>
	<li><B>Learn and Practice Good Study Habits.</b>  such as setting goals; learning effective reading, note taking, and test taking strategies; attending classes, completing assignments on time; and organizing your study area.  </li>
	<li><B>Learn About and Use Campus Resources That Can Help You.</b>  College counselors and advisors, health services, faculty, study skills assistance programs, tutors, local clergy, and other campus professionals.  </li>
	</ul></P>
	<P>No one can promise that the transition from home to the end of the first year will be easy. Relax and take college one step at a time. And when you arrive on campus look around. First-years do survive - notice the large number of sophomores!</P>

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Choosing Classes/Major</span></b>
    <hr> <P>When you first find out, usually in the summer before you enter college, that you have to register for classes, it can be very scary. What classes do you take? What is your major? How do you understand what requirements you have to fulfill? Many universities have specific requirements for first-year students and those requirements are explained in the catalog, student handbook, or can be found out by calling the school and asking an academic advisor.  Remember that whatever classes you choose for your first semester at college are not set in stone and will not determine the rest of your life. Often times, you can change classes throughout the first week or two of the semester, and you usually do not have to declare your major until the second year. Guidance counselors say that 75% of students change their majors after they enter college. College is not just about careers and money - it's a place for learning about yourself and the world.<a href="transition.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Academic Stuff - Fears and Concerns</span></b>
    <hr> <P>Whether you were top of the class or at the bottom, almost every college student enters college feeling inadequate academically.
If not, they enter into college with the idea that it will be "as easy as high school,"
and are suddenly stunned into reality when finals arrive and they haven't yet started the reading for the course.
Chances are that the institution you choose to attend is full of people who were academically similar to you in high school,
as well as with people who you feel are much smarter and perhaps even those few people that you wonder how they manage to get by in life.
It is always important to remember that many people are  coming in with the similar fears,
and that as long as you learn a good way to manage your time and academics, you will succeed (easier said than done...).

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Competition and Pressure</span></b>
    <hr>

<p>From grade school to grad school and beyond, our world is becoming increasingly competitive. The pressure is on students to excel in every subject, in addition to in athletics and clubs, and full or part time jobs. Today's college woman has a lot on her plate. People respond to pressure and competition differently, and different schools have vastly different climates. Some schools carry reputations for being extremely demanding and competitive. Some students are better able to handle competition and pressure than others. For some, college is their first experience with such pressure, others have come form extremely competitive secondary schools and are more accustomed to the pressure.
Even outstanding students who stood out in high school may find themselves to be average students at college.
This can be a very difficult and stressful situation,
and hard to come to terms with.
Some students will let pressure build until it is too much for them to handle.
Pressure affects students of every major, from the arts to the sciences and pre-medical studies. </p>

<p>Realizing that your work in college does not define who you are and
that your worth as an individual is not defined by your grades at
school is an essential fact. After all, you came to college to live
and learn, not get A's at any cost. Set reasonable goals for yourself.
Find stimulating and relaxing activities, and think about who you are as a
person-not just who you are as a student, what you want in life, and what
things other than academics make you feel happy and fulfilled.</p>

<p>Some students respond to pressure by cheating.
Even at universities
with strict honor codes, cheating has become rampant.
In the world of
grading curves, cheating does not only hurt the cheater, but the
legitimate learner as well as campus morale. </p>

<p>Other students will respond to the pressure to achieve very
differently. These students
instead become stressed and anxious, depressed or completely
overwhelmed. Unable to cope, every year, some college students
<a href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/suicideprevention/index.cfm">
commit suicide
</a>
in response to academic pressure, depression, substance abuse, and other
factors.</p>

<p>To cope with pressure and competition, it is important to realize
that your performance in college does not define your worth as a
person. Wherever the source of your pressure is, whether yourself, or
parents, in the grand scheme of things, it is essential to find other
important things in your life--doing things you enjoy, and realizing
that your personal happiness is more important than achieving someone else's
vision of success.</p>

<p>If you or a friend seems unable to cope with the pressures of
college, there are several things you can do.
(The following suggestions come from
<a href="http://counseling.ucr.edu/Faculty+and+Staff/Distressed+Student+Anxious.htm">
http://counseling.ucr.edu/Faculty+and+Staff/Distressed+Student+Anxious.htm
</a>
)
</p>

<p>
It is helpful to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let the student discuss his/her feelings and thoughts. Often this alone relieves some of the pressure</li>

<li>Provide reassurance</li>
<li>Remain calm and talk slowly</li>
<li>Be clear and direct</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not helpful to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimize the perceived threat to which the student is reacting</li>
<li>Take responsibility for his/her emotional state</li>
<li>Overwhelm him/her with information or ideas to "fix" their condition</li>
<li>Become anxious or overwhelmed</li>
</ul>

<p>If a more serious response is warranted, it may be appropriate to advise your friend or go with him or her to your school's counseling service, as well as making the other people who care deeply about your friend aware, so that they can provide a support network.</p>

<p>How to find help:
Many schools provide counseling as well as maintain 24-hour hotlines to support students experiencing the pressures and demands for college life.</p>

<p>A national toll free telephone line for graduate students in crisis may be reached at 1-877-GRAD-HLP.</p>

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">What to Bring/Buy</span></b>
    <hr> <P>While looking around your room at home at all the little mementos that you think you ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE at college, remember that dorm rooms are small. Dorm rooms traditionally are the size of a small bathroom, but two people live in that space, sometimes three, four or five. Ok, slight exaggeration, but keep in mind that the space you will be living in at college is small and you are probably going to be sharing it with one other person (at least).</P>
	<P>After you have eliminated from your baggage the twelve trophies you won in sixth grade and the collection of sea shells from preschool, you should begin to make a checklist of items that you need to bring. Also, if you have a roommate that you know of ahead of time, it is always a good idea to coordinate items with them to cut down on costs, as well as prevent a situation where you have multiple microwaves, but no fridge. Here is a checklist of items to consider (not all are necessary) but these are ones that my college students often find to be useful.</P>
<P>This is a general list of helpful items.  Different schools have different rules about items allowed in dorm rooms, so check with your school before packing any major electrical appliance (like a refrigerator or microwave). </P>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Computer:</b>  Most schools have computer clusters available for you to use to check email, write papers and do other things, but if you can afford to have your own, it is a great luxury. You should consider your own needs in deciding what kind of computer you would bring. Additionally, if you are buying a new computer, many schools offer discounts if you buy it from them. Check with technology services at your college or university to see what they have to offer.
	</li><li><b>Refrigerator:</b>  There are many different size refrigerators that people use in their dorm rooms. Some have freezers and some do not. Others come with a microwave attached. Talk with your roommate(s) in deciding what type you would want. Also, many schools offer services from which you can rent or purchase refrigerators.
	</li><li><b>Microwave</b>
	</li><li><b>Television:</b>  having a television has its plusses and minuses- weigh the options before deciding what you want.
	</li><li><b>VCR:</b>  To record the shows you missed on those nights you can't watch TV because you are studying.
	</li><li><b>Stereo:</b>  with headphones - so that your roommates will not be bothered
	</li><li><b>Power strip/surge protector</b>
	</li><li><b>Sports equipmen:</b>  field hockey stick, soccer ball, basketball, etc.
	</li><li><b>Desk Lamp</b>
	</li><li><b>Alarm Clock</b>
	</li><li><b>Laundry bag (or basket)</b>
	</li><li><b>Laundry soap</b>
	</li><li><b>Needles and thread or safety pins</b>
	</li><li><b>Eating utensils</b>
	</li><li><b>Bedding:</b>  Bring a good blanket because it may get cold in some residence halls.
	</li><li><b>Decorations for your room (photos/posters)</b>
	</li><li><b>Iron and small ironing board</b>
	</li><li><b>Organizer or planner (calendar)</b>
	</li><li><b>Bike and bike lock</b>
	</li><li><b>Fan</b>
	</li><li><b>Bath towels, soaps, robe, toiletries, etc.</b>
	</li><li><b>Can-opener</b>
	</li><li><b>First aid kit</b>
	</li><li><b>Band aids</b>
	</li><li><b>Pain reliever</b>
	</li><li><b>Shower shoes</b>
	</li><li><b>Umbrella</b>
	</li></ul>
  	<P>More importantly, here are some items that you should leave at home:
	<ul>
	<li><b>Pets (Fish are usually okay):</b>  Check with your college or university on their policies regarding pets. Most institutions will not allow them.
	</li><li><b>Full size refrigerator:</b>  The rooms are only this big.
</li><li><b>Extension cord:</b> Generally not allowed because they can be a fire hazard.  Bring extra power strips WITH surge protectors instead.
	</li><li><b>Firearms</b>
	</li><li><b>Expensive clothing and jewelry:</b>  Unfortunately theft does occur at college, so try not to bring unnecessary expensive items <a href="transition.html#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Roommate Situations</span></b>
    <hr> <P>So perhaps you have never shared a room before, or maybe you have shared a room with a sibling. Whatever the case may be, living with a roommate that you have probably never met before can be scary. Whatever living situation you are in, a double in a dorm room, a suite, a sorority house or whatever, you are likely to have a roommate at some point. At first it may seem like a wonderful ideal world with double the amount of clothes and constant sleepovers, but it is important to set rules from the beginning to protect both you and your roommate(s) from getting too hurt, too stressed out or too angry.</P>
	<P>Here are some ideas to help prevent future arguments:
	<ul>
	<li>Lay down the rules in the beginning, i.e. how late people can call, when you like to go to bed, when you like to get up, borrowing stuff from each other, etc. It is a good idea to do this within the first week of school so that you both know the rules of the game.
	</li><li>If your roommate has done something that upsets you, talk to her about it before it gets too out of hand. For example, if she has borrowed your favorite sweater and you did not give her permission to, let her know how it makes you feel and that it is not acceptable.
	</li><li>As with any relationship, when there is an argument, fight fairly. Use "I" statements, as in, "I feel upset when you ...." Nobody can argue with the way you feel. Don't be accusatory because it will only put her on the defensive side and you will not get anywhere with the discussion.
	</li><li>Remember that this is her space as well as your space. Perhaps she is not as big a Star Trek fan as you are and the life-size Yoda poster is freaking her out a little bit.
	</li></ul></P>
