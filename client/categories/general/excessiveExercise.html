 <hr>
<p>
There are many benefits of exercise, including
   better health, longer life, more energy, and a better daily state of mind.
   However, too much exercise can be a dangerous thing--leading to
   irritability, increased risk of injury, and poorer physical and mental
   performance. Obsessive exercise may indicate the presence of an eating
   disorder, including anorexea nervosa or bulemia. <BR>So when exactly does
   a healthy habit become unhealthy? This question is difficult to answer,
   but generally speaking, the benefits of exercise depend on three factors:
<UL>
<LI>Frequency: days per week on which you exercise</LI>
<LI>Intensity:how hard your heart is working while you exercise</LI>
<LI>Duration: how long you spend exercising during each session</LI>
</UL></p>

<P>Try to be physically active for 30-60 minutes, at least 5 days a week
   Doubling your workout duration or
   frequency does not necessarily double the benefits of your routine, and
   may have emotional and physical consequences.</P>

 <hr>

If you are concerned that you may exercise too much, think about how you would answer the following
   questions:
<OL>

<LI>Do you find that you regularly adjust your exercise according to how much you ate earlier or on the preceding day?</LI>
<LI>Are you concerned to terrified about being overweight?</LI>
<LI>Did your interest in exercise begin with a desire to lose weight?</LI>
<LI>Do you fear not exercising each day because you think you'll gain weight?</LI>
<LI>Are you preoccupied with food and calories and calculate what you are allowed to eat each day
   according to how much time you can give to exercise?</LI>
<LI>Have you gone on eating binges where you feel you cannot stop?</LI>
<LI>Do you exercise an excessive amount after binge?</LI>
<LI>Are you preoccupied with being thinner, and have a lower body mass/lean muscle ratio as elite athletes do?</LI>
<LI>Do you think about burning aclories as you exercise?</LI>
<LI>Do you ever vomit, take laxatives, or diuretics after a meal or binge to feel thinner or to
   attempt to lose calories?</LI>
<LI>Do you feel virtuous when dieting, restricting your dietary intake, or exercising?</LI>
<LI>Do others tell you that you exercise too much?</LI>
</OL>
<p>
If you answered even half of these questions
   with a yes, you may be exercising too much. What to do: If you are
   concerned that you or a friend are exercising to excess, it is important
   to see a health professional, such as a doctor, trainer, or nutritionist.
   A professional is likely to give you a medical examination in order to
   identify any potentially serious complications, to advise you to take a
   break from training, and to ensure proper nutrition.
