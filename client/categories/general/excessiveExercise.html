              There are many benefits of exercise, including
               better health, longer life, more energy, and a better daily state of mind.
               However, too much exercise can be a dangerous thing--leading to
               irritability, increased risk of injury, and poorer physical and mental
               performance. Obsessive exercise may indicate the presence of an eating
               disorder, including anorexea nervosa or bulemia. <BR>So when exactly does
               a healthy habit become unhealthy? This question is difficult to answer,
               but generally speaking, the benefits of exercise depend on three factors:
              <ul>
              <li>Frequency: days per week on which you exercise</li>
              <li>Intensity:how hard your heart is working while you exercise</li>
              <li>Duration: how long you spend exercising during each session</li>
              </ul></p>             

              <p>Try to be physically active for 30-60 minutes, at least 5 days a week
                 Doubling your workout duration or
                 frequency does not necessarily double the benefits of your routine, and
                 may have emotional and physical consequences.</p>

                <p>Exercise is one of the best things you can do for your health today and tomorrow,
                but excessive exercise can have physical consequences such as stress fractures,
                tendonitis, joint and ligament injuries, and irregular menstruation.
                There may be emotional and social effects as well.</p>

                <p>Are you exercising too much? So where is the line between just
                right and too much? The line is different for different people, depending
                on:</p>
                <ul><li>Your source of motivation or reason for exercise</li>
                <li>How exercise relates to the rest of your life, for instance, a career or sport</li>
                <li>Your attitude toward exercise, your body, and your health</li>

                If you are concerned that you may exercise too much, think about how you would answer the following
                questions:
                <ol>               
                <li>Do you find that you regularly adjust your exercise according to how much you ate earlier or on the preceding day?</li>
                <li>Are you concerned to terrified about being overweight?</li>
                <li>Did your interest in exercise begin with a desire to lose weight?</li>
                <li>Do you fear not exercising each day because you think you'll gain weight?</li>
                <li>Are you preoccupied with food and calories and calculate what you are allowed to eat each day
                   according to how much time you can give to exercise?</li>
                <li>Have you gone on eating binges where you feel you cannot stop?</li>
                <li>Do you exercise an excessive amount after binge?</li>
                <li>Are you preoccupied with being thinner, and have a lower body mass/lean muscle ratio as elite athletes do?</li>
                <li>Do you think about burning aclories as you exercise?</li>
                <li>Do you ever vomit, take laxatives, or diuretics after a meal or binge to feel thinner or to
                   attempt to lose calories?</li>
                <li>Do you feel virtuous when dieting, restricting your dietary intake, or exercising?</li>
                <li>Do others tell you that you exercise too much?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                If you answered even half of these questions
                   with a yes, you may be exercising too much. What to do: If you are
                   concerned that you or a friend are exercising to excess, it is important
                   to see a health professional, such as a doctor, trainer, or nutritionist.
                   A professional is likely to give you a medical examination in order to
                   identify any potentially serious complications, to advise you to take a
                   break from training, and to ensure proper nutrition.
