<b><span style="font-size:12pt">Introduction</span></b>
<hr>

<p>The disease mononucleosis is most common in people 10 to
35 years old, with its peak incidence in those 15 to 17 years
old. Only 50 people out of 100,000 in the general population
get mono, but it strikes as many as 2 out of 1,000 teens and
twenty-somethings, especially those in high school, college,
and the military. While mono is not usually considered a
serious illness, it may have serious complications and can
sometimes be life-threatening. Without a doubt your lifestyle
will change for several months.<a href="mononucleosis___ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=

<b><span style="font-size:12pt">Who is At Risk?</span></b>
<hr>


<p>While there are many illnesses that teens and young adults
don't get, unfortunately, mono is most common among
15-35 year olds.  The reason that not everyone comes
down with mono during these years is that most of the
population has already exposed to the virus that causes mono
(usually the Epstein-Barr virus) before we reach the age of
18.  Exposure at a young age usually is asymptomatic,
meaning that no symptoms result, or instead may seem like a
cold.  This type of exposure usually makes us immune to
re-infection later on in life.  However if exposure has
not occurred by the age of 18 then encountering EBV often
results in mono.</p>

<div id="mononucleosis__causes"><hr/>
<b><span style="font-size:12pt">What Causes Mono?</span></b>
<hr>

<p>Two viruses can cause mono: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and
cytomegalovirus (CMV). Both viruses are in the herpes family,
whose other members include viruses responsible for cold
sores and chickenpox.  The EBV is responsible for
approximately 85% of mono cases.  Both of these viruses,
like other Herpes viruses, have no cure and will stay in your
body for life.<a href="mononucleosis___ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=

disease", and with good reason.  It is found in
moist exhaled air, nasal and oral secretions like saliva and
mucus, and is not as easy to transmit as many other viruses
such as colds.  It generally requires direct contact,
like kissing, though it can be spread by other means as well,
such as coughing.  A person with mono is most contagious
just before they feel sick and while they ARE sick because
this is the time when the most viral particles are
produced.  Even after you have completely recovered, you
can still spread the virus that causes mono.  Every so
often you can produce the virus in your saliva and spread it
to another person, even if you feel fine.</p>

flu and include fever, sore throat, and swollen lymph glands.
Sometimes, a swollen spleen or liver involvement may develop.
These symptoms usually last for more than two days and may
appear slowly. Heart problems or involvement of the central
nervous system occurs only rarely, and mono is almost never
fatal. </p><a href="mononucleosis___ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=

when taken care of, the disease goes away within a couple of
months.  There are some instances when complications can
arise.  One such complication may include enlargement
and rupture of the <b>spleen</b>. define  This is a
serious concern because it can lead to death.  Some of
the signs and symptoms of this complication include pain in
your upper left abdomen, difficulty breathing,
lightheadedness, excessive bleeding, and feeling like your
heart is beating harder and faster than normal.  A very
common complication is dehydration.  A sore throat can
make you hesitant to drink enough fluids so that you become
dehydrated.  There are also several other rare
complications that include:</p>

the basis of the symptoms of fever, sore throat, swollen
lymph glands, and the age of the patient. Usually, laboratory
tests are needed for confirmation. Blood test results for
people with mono include a high white blood cell count, an
increased percentage of certain atypical white blood cells,
and a positive reaction to a "mono spot" test.<a href="mononucleosis___ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=
""><sup>[4]</sup></a>
This test is
designed to look to see if your blood <b>platelet</b> count
is too low and if your white blood cells are abnormal.
A blood chemistry panel can be done to see if the enzymes in
your liver are abnormal, which can be a sign that you have
mono. </p>

<p>Mono tests may not show positive results until you have
been sick for a few days.  This is because it may take
about five days or so for your body to produce enough
antibodies to show up on the test.  If your mono test is
negative and you are still feeling sick after a couple of
days, you may want to consider a follow-up visit with your
doctor.   It is sometimes necessary to be tested
more than once; after a week or two of being sick the tests
are approximately 85% accurate.</p>

<b><span style="font-size:12pt">How is Mono Treated?</span></b>
<hr>

<p>There is no specific treatment for mononucleosis, other
than treating the symptoms. No antiviral drugs or vaccines
are available. Some physicians have prescribed a 5-day course
of steroids to control the swelling of the throat and
tonsils. The use of steroids has also been reported to
decrease the overall length and severity of illness, but
these reports have not been published.  Therefore, the
best course of action is to rest and let you body fight the
virus.  You can feel more comfortable when you are sick
by taking some over-the-counter medications to alleviate
symptoms. </p>

<ul>
<li>Acetaminophen for fever (no aspirin)</li>

<li>Ibuprofen for pain (consult your doctor if you want to
take aspirin)</li>

<li>Rest (plan to take lots of naps)</li>

<li>Drink more fluids (at least 2 quarts a day)</li>

<li>Throat lozenges, salt water gargle, and ice cream for your
sore throat</li>

<li>No vigorous exercise, contact sports, or heavy lifting</li>

<li>Antibiotics if strep throat or another bacterial infection
is present (this is determined by your doctor)</li>

<li>Good nutrition and NO alcohol</li>

<li>It can take anywhere from one week to three months to
fully recover, so take care of your body and continue to rest
until your doctor says it's ok to get back to your
normal routine.</li>

is the incubation period (you've been exposed to the
virus, but you feel normal) that can last as long as 2-6
weeks.  The prodromal period is next (the time just
before you get sick, but you feel like you're
"coming down with something") and lasts from
3-5 days.  Generally symptoms at this point include
fatigue, lack of appetite, and an overall
"blah" feeling.  The third stage is called
the acute stage (you ARE sick), which usually lasts from 7-20
days.  Now you have the symptoms of mono like sore
throat, fever, swollen glands, etc.  The final stage,
the convalescent period, can last from 2-6 weeks to up to 3
months.  During this time you'll feel much
better, but are still weak and tired.</p>

up to two months to develop symptoms and you can be
contagious for as long as a year afterward and at different
points in your lifetime.  By the time you realize that
you have mono, it's usually too late to find out where
you got it from and prevent other people from getting it
too.  The best way to protect yourself is to get plenty
of rest and keep yourself healthy (no all-nighters, or at
least not too many in a row).  Try to maintain a
healthy, nutritious diet, practice good personal hygiene, and
don't share plates and silverware.</p>
