   <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Keeping fit in college</span></b>
   <hr>  <P>In college, time is a finite resource and often students place exercise
     at the bottom of their list of priorities.&nbsp; It is pretty easy to
     spend the entire day running from class to class, meeting to meeting, and
     then realize that the day is over. Some of us even have jobs on top of our
     many scholastic responsibilities.&nbsp; Oh yes, and we must also make time
     to have some fun with our friends.&nbsp; With all of these obligations and
     the fact that we are pulled in all different directions, it is no wonder
     that college students have difficulty adding daily exercise to their
     schedules.&nbsp;</P>
     <P>However, keeping fit by exercising is important and has many health
     benefits.&nbsp; Surprisingly enough, by making minor changes in your
     schedule, you just might find a few extra minutes to make a quick trip to
     the gym or to go for a little jog.&nbsp; For example, even taking the
     stairs instead of the elevator or walking hastily to classes counts as
     physical activity.&nbsp; You don't have to look good in Lycra or belong to
     a fancy health spa to be physically active!!</P>
     <P>This fact sheet outlines the benefits of exercise, gives guidelines for
     making the most of your exercise time and gives suggestions as to how you
     can fit daily exercise into your schedule.&nbsp; Just thirty minutes a day
     (not necessarily all at once), five days a week of some type of physical
     activity can make a real difference to your health today and
     tomorrow.&nbsp; Keep in mind, though, that the more vigorous the physical
     activity, the better the health benefits.</P>

 <div id="effective"><hr/>
   <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Effective exercising</span></b>
   <hr> <P>Before you begin your workout, you should warm up for five minutes by
     doing some light aerobic exercise, such as jogging slowly or walking
     briskly.&nbsp; This stretching will prepare your body for a more intense
     workout and will prevent injury.&nbsp; You might also want to stretch the
     muscles that you plan to work on.</P>
     <P>There are several measures that you can take in order to maximize the
     benefit of your workout and prevent injury including:
     <UL>
       <LI>Drink plenty of water </LI>
       <LI>Make exercising a part of your daily routine </LI>
       <LI>Start gradually </LI>
       <LI>Increase exercise time each day, up to 30-60 minutes </LI>
       <LI>Rest when feeling faint or short of breath </LI>
       <LI>Keep a record of your workouts and progress </LI>
       <LI>Keep yourself occupied while you exercise- read, listen to music,
       chat with a friend, etc. </LI></UL></p>
     <P>Never end a work out abruptly.&nbsp; Instead, slowly bring down your
     heart rate.&nbsp; You can do this by slowly decreasing the intensity of
     your work out, or walking until your heart rate returns to normal.

 <div id="exercise__aerobic"><hr/>
   <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Aerobic exercise</span></b>
   <hr> <P>In order to build endurance, you should engage in aerobic exercise for
     an extended period of time (20-30 minutes).&nbsp; This will improve the
     health of your heart, lungs, and blood vessels.&nbsp; The American Heart
     Association recommends that you shoot for your targeted heart rate in
     order to maximize your workout.  At this rate, your heart will most
     efficiently pump blood.&nbsp; Your target heart rate equals about 50-75%
     of your heart's maximum rate.&nbsp; This can be calculated by subtracting
     your age from 220.&nbsp; </p>
     <P>Types of aerobic exercise include, but are not limited to, the
     following:
     <UL>
       <LI>Walking </LI>
       <LI>Running </LI>
       <LI>Swimming </LI>

       <LI>Rowing </LI>

     <P>Several of these activities are weight-bearing exercises, which means
     they are

   <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Weight training</span></b>
   <hr> <P>Weight training can build strength and improve your muscle tone.&nbsp;
     When lifting weights, you should give muscles a day or two to rest between
     workouts.&nbsp; This will prevent injury.&nbsp;</P>
     <P>There are other ways to build muscles that do not require lifting
     weights.&nbsp; These include calisthenics, bicycling, swimming, hiking,
     golfing, rowing, tennis, and many others.&nbsp;</p>

 <div id="exercise__school"><hr/>
   <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Exercising at School</span></b>
   <hr>  <P>Take advantage of the many facilities available to you at your college
     for physical activity.&nbsp; There may be a work out facility or gym on
     your campus that, as a student, you can use cheaply or free of
     charge.&nbsp; Tennis courts, biking paths, basketball courts, and soccer
     fields are also widely available on college campuses.&nbsp; Furthermore,
     there may be physical education classes that you can take for advanced
     skill building if your are just getting started in a workout
     routine.&nbsp; This might help you determine your personal fitness level
     and give you an idea as to what types of exercise you enjoy.</P>
     <P>Most types of exercise can double as social events.&nbsp; Going to the
     gym or for a run with a friend will allow you to spend time with someone
     that you might not see or talk to as much as you like.&nbsp; Team sports
     can also provide another opportunity to meet people and to get in shape at
     the same time.</P>
     <P>If you would rather exercise alone, this can also provide an excellent
     opportunity for you to be alone with your thoughts.&nbsp; Getting away
     from the campus by going for a walk/run will allow for an escape from the
     pressures of school and will allow you to have uninterrupted
     thoughts.&nbsp; You might find that after getting away and exercising
     alone, you will return to campus refreshed and more prepared to face your
     campus responsibilities.</P>

   <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Fitting it into your schedule</span></b>
   <hr> <P>With various activities, classes, work, social life, etc. it can be
     difficult to fathom adding yet another element to our busy days.&nbsp;
     However, all it takes is 20-30 minutes a day.&nbsp; After all how many
     minutes did you spend doing unnecessary things today? Between E-mailing,
     chatting with friends, and various other time consuming activities, you
     could probably figure out a way to scrape together 20-30 minutes a
     day.&nbsp; Try it! Look at what you did today and try to figure out how
     you can make better use of your time, allowing a few extra minutes for
     exercise.&nbsp; It may sound like a formidable task, but take a closer
     look -- you might be surprised.</P>
     <P>If you are simply unable to find a solid 30-minute chunk of time during
     your day, consider trying to accumulate 30 minutes of exercise throughout
     the day.&nbsp; You could take the long route to a class, take the stairs,
     do a few jumping jacks in the morning, go dancing at night, or any number
     of other things.</P>

     <P>By individualizing your workout to fit your personal fitness goals, you
     will make better use of the time that you spend exercising.&nbsp; Also,
     determining the types of exercise that you enjoy will keep you on track
     and help you <a href="http://www.stfrancishospitals.org/">stick with it</a>.  First, decide whether you like to
     exercise alone or with someone else.&nbsp; Having an obligation to another
     person may help you stick to your work out program, but it could also slow
     you down.&nbsp; Next, decide whether you prefer exercising outside or
     inside.&nbsp; There are many different types of physical activities that
     can be done in both settings.&nbsp; Finally, you may want to vary your
     work out in order to keep things interesting and prevent boredom with your

     and excited about physical activity:
     <UL>
       <LI>Focus on short-term goals, and change them as you grow stronger. </LI>
       <LI>Ask for support from friends and family. </LI>
       <LI>Make sure you enjoy your work out.&nbsp; If you don't, reassess and
       change what you are doing.&nbsp; Find activities that you like. </LI>
       <LI>Read up on the subject- check online resources and magazines for
       exercise tips. </LI>
       <LI>Treat yourself to exercise clothes and shoes that you enjoy wearing. </LI>

       <LI>Keep a record of your workouts and progress. </LI>
       <LI>If you stop for some reason (illness, busy schedule, or travel) come
       back to it-but slowly- and don't beat yourself up over your missed work
       outs.&nbsp; Everyone deserves a break once in a while. </LI></UL></p>
