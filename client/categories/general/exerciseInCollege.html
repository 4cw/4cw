                <p>In college, time is a finite resource and often students place exercise
                at the bottom of their list of priorities.&nbsp; It is pretty easy to
                 spend the entire day running from class to class, meeting to meeting, and
                 then realize that the day is over. Some of us even have jobs on top of our
                 many scholastic responsibilities.&nbsp; Oh yes, and we must also make time
                 to have some fun with our friends.&nbsp; With all of these obligations and
                 the fact that we are pulled in all different directions, it is no wonder
                 that college students have difficulty adding daily exercise to their
                 schedules.&nbsp;</p>
                 <p>However, keeping fit by exercising is important and has many health
                 benefits.&nbsp; Surprisingly enough, by making minor changes in your
                 schedule, you just might find a few extra minutes to make a quick trip to
                 the gym or to go for a little jog.&nbsp; For example, even taking the
                 stairs instead of the elevator or walking hastily to classes counts as
                 physical activity.&nbsp; You don't have to look good in Lycra or belong to
                 a fancy health spa to be physically active!!</p>
                 <p>This fact sheet outlines the benefits of exercise, gives guidelines for
                 making the most of your exercise time and gives suggestions as to how you
                 can fit daily exercise into your schedule.&nbsp; Just thirty minutes a day
                 (not necessarily all at once), five days a week of some type of physical
                 activity can make a real difference to your health today and
                 tomorrow.&nbsp; Keep in mind, though, that the more vigorous the physical
                 activity, the better the health benefits.</p>

                 <p>Long term and short term <a href="http://womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/physical-activity.html">health benefits to exercise</a> include:

                 <p>Not only does exercise improve health and physical well being, but it
                 will also make you feel better about your body and yourself, increase
                 muscle tone, improve your mood, clear your head, and help you to

                <p>Before you begin your workout, you should warm up for five minutes by
                 doing some light aerobic exercise, such as jogging slowly or walking
                 briskly.&nbsp; This stretching will prepare your body for a more intense
                 workout and will prevent injury.&nbsp; You might also want to stretch the
                 muscles that you plan to work on.</p>
                 <p>There are several measures that you can take in order to maximize the
                 benefit of your workout and prevent injury including:
                 <ul>
                   <li>Drink plenty of water </li>
                   <li>Make exercising a part of your daily routine </li>
                   <li>Start gradually </li>
                   <li>Increase exercise time each day, up to 30-60 minutes </li>
                   <li>Rest when feeling faint or short of breath </li>
                   <li>Keep a record of your workouts and progress </li>
                   <li>Keep yourself occupied while you exercise- read, listen to music,
                   chat with a friend, etc. </li></ul></p>
                 <p>Never end a work out abruptly.&nbsp; Instead, slowly bring down your
                 heart rate.&nbsp; You can do this by slowly decreasing the intensity of
                 your work out, or walking until your heart rate returns to normal.

                <p>In order to build endurance, you should engage in aerobic exercise for
                an extended period of time (20-30 minutes).&nbsp; This will improve the
                 health of your heart, lungs, and blood vessels.&nbsp; The American Heart
                 Association recommends that you shoot for your targeted heart rate in
                 order to maximize your workout.  At this rate, your heart will most
                 efficiently pump blood.&nbsp; Your target heart rate equals about 50-75%
                 of your heart's maximum rate.&nbsp; This can be calculated by subtracting
                 your age from 220.&nbsp; </p>
                 <p>Types of aerobic exercise include, but are not limited to, the
                 following:
                 <ul>
                   <li>Walking </li>
                   <li>Running </li>

                   <li>Hiking </li>
                   <li>Cross country skiing </li>
                   <li>Jump rope </li>

                   <li>Stair-climbing </li></ul></p>

                <p>Weight training can build strength and improve your muscle tone.&nbsp;
                When lifting weights, you should give muscles a day or two to rest between
                workouts.&nbsp; This will prevent injury.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>There are other ways to build muscles that do not require lifting
                weights.&nbsp; These include calisthenics, bicycling, swimming, hiking,
                golfing, rowing, tennis, and many others.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Take advantage of the many facilities available to you at your college
                 for physical activity.&nbsp; There may be a work out facility or gym on
                 your campus that, as a student, you can use cheaply or free of
                 charge.&nbsp; Tennis courts, biking paths, basketball courts, and soccer
                 fields are also widely available on college campuses.&nbsp; Furthermore,
                 there may be physical education classes that you can take for advanced
                 skill building if your are just getting started in a workout
                 routine.&nbsp; This might help you determine your personal fitness level
                 and give you an idea as to what types of exercise you enjoy.</p>
                 <p>Most types of exercise can double as social events.&nbsp; Going to the
                 gym or for a run with a friend will allow you to spend time with someone
                 that you might not see or talk to as much as you like.&nbsp; Team sports
                 can also provide another opportunity to meet people and to get in shape at
                 the same time.</p>
                 <p>If you would rather exercise alone, this can also provide an excellent
                 opportunity for you to be alone with your thoughts.&nbsp; Getting away
                 from the campus by going for a walk/run will allow for an escape from the
                 pressures of school and will allow you to have uninterrupted
                 thoughts.&nbsp; You might find that after getting away and exercising
                 alone, you will return to campus refreshed and more prepared to face your
                 campus responsibilities.</p>

                <p>With various activities, classes, work, social life, etc. it can be
                difficult to fathom adding yet another element to our busy days.&nbsp;
                 However, all it takes is 20-30 minutes a day.&nbsp; After all how many
                 minutes did you spend doing unnecessary things today? Between E-mailing,
                 chatting with friends, and various other time consuming activities, you
                 could probably figure out a way to scrape together 20-30 minutes a
                 day.&nbsp; Try it! Look at what you did today and try to figure out how
                 you can make better use of your time, allowing a few extra minutes for
                 exercise.&nbsp; It may sound like a formidable task, but take a closer
                 look -- you might be surprised.</p>
                 <p>If you are simply unable to find a solid 30-minute chunk of time during
                 your day, consider trying to accumulate 30 minutes of exercise throughout
                 the day.&nbsp; You could take the long route to a class, take the stairs,
                 do a few jumping jacks in the morning, go dancing at night, or any number

                    <li>Focus on short-term goals, and change them as you grow stronger. </li>

                    <li>Read up on the subject- check online resources and magazines for
                    exercise tips. </li>
                    <li>Treat yourself to exercise clothes and shoes that you enjoy wearing. </li>

                    <li>Keep a record of your workouts and progress. </li>
                    <li>If you stop for some reason (illness, busy schedule, or travel) come
                    back to it-but slowly- and don't beat yourself up over your missed work
                    outs.&nbsp; Everyone deserves a break once in a while. </li></ul></p>
