		<h3>Breast Cancer in Men</h3>
		<p>While 99% of all breast cancer cases are in women, there are some men who develop similar changes. The vast majority of breast cancers in men, therefore, arise in the area at the center of the breast beneath the nipple and areola, rather than in the outer quadrants so commonly affected in women. A painless lump or abnormalities around the nipple are the most common complaints made by men who are found to have breast cancer.</p>
