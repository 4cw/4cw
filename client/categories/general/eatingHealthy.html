                 Eating healthy means feeding your body all the <a href="{{pathFor 'nutrients'}}">nutrients</a> it needs to sustain your daily activities.  You need more than 40 different nutrients for good health. <a href="http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/6-essential-nutrients-functions-4877.html">Essential nutrients</a> include vitamins, minerals, amino acids from protein, certain <span class=smalldict>FATTY ACIDS</span> from fat, and sources of calories (protein, carbohydrates, and fat).
                <p>Different foods contain different nutrients and other healthful substances. No single food can supply all the nutrients in the amounts you need. For example, oranges provide vitamin C and folate but no vitamin B<sub>12</sub> ; cheese provides calcium and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> but no vitamin C. To make sure you get all the nutrients and other substances you need for health, build a healthy base by using the Food Guide Pyramid as a starting point. Choose the recommended number of daily servings from each of the five major food groups.

                 <p>Adolescents and adults over age 50 have an especially high need for calcium, but most people need to eat plenty of good sources of calcium for healthy bones throughout life. When selecting dairy products to get enough calcium, choose those that are low in fat or fat-free to avoid getting too much saturated fat. Young children, teenage girls, and women of childbearing age need enough good sources of iron, such as lean meats and cereals with added nutrients, to keep up their iron stores. Women who could become pregnant need extra folic acid.</p>
                <p>For a woman in your age range, the USDA recommends the following daily servings:(<a href="eating_healthy.html#1">1</a>)</p>

                <p>Some people need a vitamin-mineral supplement to meet specific nutrient needs. For example, women who could become pregnant are advised to eat foods fortified with folic acid or to take a folic acid supplement in addition to consuming folate-rich foods to reduce the risk of some serious birth defects. People with little exposure to sunlight may need a vitamin D supplement. People who seldom eat dairy products or other rich sources of calcium need a calcium supplement, and people who eat no animal foods need to take a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> supplement. Sometimes vitamins or minerals are prescribed for meeting nutrient needs or for therapeutic purposes. For example, health care providers may advise pregnant women to take an iron supplement.</p>
                <p>Supplements of some nutrients, such as vitamin A and selenium, can be harmful if taken in large amounts. Because foods contain many substances that promote health, use the Food Guide Pyramid when choosing foods. Don't depend on supplements to meet your usual nutrient needs.</p>
                <p>Dietary supplements include not only vitamins and minerals, but also amino acids, fiber, herbal products, and many other substances that are widely available. Herbal products usually provide a very small amount of vitamins and minerals. The value of herbal products for health is currently being studied. Standards for their purity, potency, and composition are being developed.</p>
