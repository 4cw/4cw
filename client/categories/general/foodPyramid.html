              <p>Foods that are safe from harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites, and chemical contaminants are vital for healthful eating. Foodborne illness is caused by eating food that contains harmful bacteria, toxins, parasites, viruses, or chemical contaminants. Bacteria and viruses, especially Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Norwalk- like viruses, are among the most common causes of foodborne illness we know about today.</p>
              <p>Eating even a small portion of an unsafe food may make you sick. Signs and symptoms may appear within half an hour of eating a contaminated food or may not develop for up to 3 weeks. Most foodborne illness lasts a few hours or days. Some foodborne illnesses have effects that go on for weeks, months, or even years. If you think you have become ill from eating a food, consult your health care provider. </p>
              <p>How to keep food safe to eat:
              <ul>
                <li>Clean: Wash hands and surfaces often</li>
                <li>Separate: Separate raw, cooked, and ready-to-eat foods while shopping, preparing, or storing</li>
                <li>Cook: Cook foods to a safe temperature</li>
                <li>Chill: Refrigerate perishable foods promptly</li>
                <li>Check and follow the label</li>
                <li>Serve safely</li>
                <li> Keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold</li>
                <li>When in doubt, throw it out</li>

              </ul>
            </p>
              <p>Some people are at high risk for foodborne illness: pregnant women, young children, older people, or people with weakened immune systems or certain chronic illnesses. These people should avoid unpasteurized, raw, and undercooked foods. <a href="http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/cic_text/food/dietguide2000/foodsafe.htm">More information.</a></p>

                  <p>The Pyramid is a guide to healthy eating. It's not a rigid
prescription, but a framework for choosing a healthful diet
that's right for you.</p>


<p>The Pyramid calls for eating a variety of foods to get the
nutrients you need and the right amount of calories each day
to maintain or improve your weight.</p>


<p>The Pyramid also focuses on fat because most American
diets are too high in fat &ndash;especially saturated fat. A
diet low in fat will reduce your chances of getting certain
diseases and will help you maintain a healthy weight.</p>


<p>If your eating pattern does not regularly meet the requirements of the food pyramid, talk to a healthcare professional to plan a better diet. See also <a href="{{pathFor 'eatingHealthy'}}">Eating Healthy</a>.</p>

                  <p>The Food Guide Pyramid emphasizes foods from the five
major food groups shown in the three lower sections of the
Pyramid. Each of these food groups provides some, but not
all, of the nutrients you need. Foods in one group can't
replace those in another. No one food group is more important
than another - for good health you need them all<i>.</i></p>

<p><b>There are many ways to create a healthy eating pattern, but they all start with the three food groups at the base of the Pyramid: grains, fruits, and vegetables. Eating a variety of grains (especially whole grain foods), fruits, and vegetables is the basis of healthy eating. Enjoy meals that have rice, pasta, tortillas, or whole grain bread at the center of the plate, accompanied by plenty of fruits and vegetables and a moderate amount of lowfat foods from the milk group and the meat and beans group. Go easy on foods high in fat or sugars.</b></p>
<p><i>The small tip of the Pyramid</i></p>


<p>Fats, oils, and sweets. These are foods such as
salad dressings and oils, cream, butter, margarine, sugars,
soft drinks, candies, and sweet desserts. These foods provide
calories and little else nutritionally. Most people should
use them sparingly.</p><p>Some fat or sugar symbols are shown in the food groups.
That's to remind you that some food choices in these food
groups can also be high in fat or added sugars. When choosing
foods for a healthful diet, consider the fat and added sugars
in your choices from the food groups.</p>
<p><i>Second Level</i></p>


<p>This level includes groups of foods that come mostly from
animals: milk, yogurt, cheese, meat, poultry, fish, dry
beans, eggs, and nuts. These foods are provide protein,
calcium, iron, and zinc.</p>

<p><i>Third</i> <i>Level</i></p>

<p>This level includes foods that come from plants, such as
vegetables and fruits. Most people need to eat more of these
foods for the vitamins, minerals, and fiber they supply.</p>

<p><i>Base of the Food Guide Pyramid</i></p>

<p>Breads, cereals, rice, and pasta - all foods from grains.
You need the proper amount of these foods each day.</p>

                    <p><i>How many servings are right for me?</i></p>

<p>The Pyramid shows a range of servings for each major food
group. The number of servings that are right for you depends
on how many calories you need, which in turn depends on your
age, sex, size, and how active you are.</p>

<p>For a woman in your age range, the USDA recommends the following daily servings:</p>

                    <div class="box">
                      <p>The amount of food that counts as a serving is listed below. If you eat a larger portion, count it as more
                           than one serving. For example, 1/2 cup of cooked pasta counts
                           as one serving in the bread, cereal, rice, and pasta group.
                           If you eat one cup of pasta, that would be two servings. If you
                           eat a smaller portion, count it as part of a serving.</p>

                           <p><i>Isn't 6 to 11 servings of breads and cereals a
                           lot?</i></p>

                           <p>It may sound like a lot, but it's really not. For example,
                           a slice of bread is one serving, so a sandwich for lunch
                           would equal two servings. A small bowl of cereal and one
                           slice of toast for breakfast are two more servings. And it
                           you have a cup of rice or pasta at dinner, that's two more
                           servings. A snack of 3 or 4 small plain crackers adds yet
                           another serving. So now you've had 7 servings. It adds up
                           quicker than you think!</p>

                           <p><i>Do I need to measure servings?</i></p>

                           <p><i>No</i>. Use servings only as a general guide. For mixed
                           foods, do the best you can to estimate the food group
                           servings of the main ingredients. For example, a generous
                           serving of pizza would count in the grain group (crust), the
                           milk group (cheese), and the vegetable group (tomato); a
                           helping of beef stew would count in the meat group and the
                           vegetable group. Both have some fat - fat in the cheese on
                           the pizza and in the gravy form the stew, if it's made from
                           meat drippings.</p>


                           <p><i>What if I want to lose or gain weight?</i></p>

                           <p>The best and simplest way to lose weight is to increase
                           your physical activity and reduce the fat and sugars in your
                           diet.</p>

                           <p>But be sure to eat at least the lowest number of servings
                           from the five major food groups in the Food Guide Pyramid.
                           You need them for the vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, and
                           protein they provide. Just try to pick the lowest fat choices
                           from the food groups.</p>

                           <p>To gain weight, increase the amounts of foods you eat from
                           all of the food groups. If you have lost weight unexpectedly,
                           see your doctor.</p>

                        <p>Don't forget to include enough water in your diet. All the cell and organ functions depend on water for functioning. It regulates body temperature and helps to alleviate constipation.

                        Water is obtained from some of the foods we eat. These are foods that are 85 to 95% water. Some water is obtained from the by-products of metabolism. But our main source of water is our drinking water, which is the best source. Water is also obtained from soup, milk, and juices. Alcoholic beverages and beverages with caffeine (such as coffee, tea, and colas) are not the best choices because they have a diuretic (water-excreting) effect.
                      </p><p>
                        If adequate water is not consumed on a daily basis the body fluids will be out of balance, causing life-threatening <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000982.htm">dehydration</a>.
                      </p><p>Six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water, or half of the body weight in ounces, are recommended on a daily basis. For example, if you weigh 140 lbs, you will need 70 ounces of water. You can visit a <a href="https://www.umsystem.edu/newscentral/totalrewards/2014/06/19/how-to-calculate-how-much-water-you-should-drink/ ">hydration calculator</a> that will determine how much water you need. Milk, juice, and soup can not be substituted for the entire water requirement. Caffeinated and alcoholic beverages (due to their diuretic effect) would not be appropriate substitutes at all.
                      </p><p>
                        Carrying a water bottle and drinking at regular intervals will help you to obtain the required amount of water your body needs.

                                  <p>Vegetables provide vitamins, such as vitamins A and C,
                                  folate, and minerals, such as iron and magnesium. They are
                                  naturally low in fat and also provide fiber. The Food Guide
                                  Pyramid suggests 3 to 5 servings of these foods a day.</p>

                                      <p>Milk products provide protein, vitamins, and minerals.
                                      Milk, yogurt, and cheese are the best source of calcium. The
                                      Food Guide Pyramid suggests 2 to 3 servings of milk, yogurt,
                                      and cheese a day -- 2 if you are 18 or under, 3 if you are 19-50.</p>

                                      in mind that 1 teaspoon (1 pat) of butter has 4 grams of
                                      fat.</p>


                                     <p><i>Selection tips</i>
                                       <ul><li>Choose skim milk and nonfat yogurt often. They are lowest
                                      in fat.&nbsp; &raquo;1-1/2 to 2 ounces of cheese and 8 ounces
                                      of yogurt count as a serving from this group because they
                                      supply the same amount of calcium as 1 cup of milk.</li>
                                      <li>Cottage cheese is lower in calcium than most cheeses. One
                                      cup of cottage cheese counts as only 1/2 serving of milk.</li>
                                      <li>Go easy on high fat cheese and ice cream. They can add a
                                      lot of fat (especially saturated fat) to your diet.</li>
                                      <li>Choose "part skim" or lowfat cheeses when available and
                                      lower fat milk desserts, like ice milk or frozen yogurt.</li>

                                        <p>Meat, poultry, and fish supply protein, B vitamins, iron,

                                        and nuts - are similar to meats in providing protein and most
                                        vitamins and minerals. The Food Guide Pyramid suggests 2 to 3
                                        servings each day of foods from this group. The total amount
                                        of these servings should be the equivalent of 5 to 6 ounces
                                        of cooked lean meat, poultry, or fish per day.</p>

                                        <ul><li>Choose lean meat, poultry without skin, fish, and dry
                                        beans and peas often. They are the choices lowest in fat.</li>
                                        <li>Prepare meats in lowfat ways:
                                          <ul><li>Trim away all the fat you can see.</li>
                                              <li>Broil, roast, or boil these foods, instead of frying
                                        them.</li></ul></li>

                                        <li>Go easy on egg yolks; they are high in cholesterol. Use
                                        only one yolk per person in egg dishes. Make larger portions
                                        by adding extra egg whites.</li>
                                        <li>Nuts and seeds are high in fat, so eat them in

                                    <p><i>How much fat can I have?</i></p>

                                          <p>It depends on your calorie needs. The Dietary Guidelines
                                          recommend that Americans limit fat in their diets to 30
                                          percent of calories. This amounts to 53 grams of fat in a
                                          1,600-calorie diet and 73 grams of fat in a 2,200-calorie diet.</p>

                                          <p></p>

                                          <p>You will get up to half this fat even if you pick the
                                          lowest fat choice from each good group and add no fat to your
                                          foods in preparation or at the table.</p>

                                          <p></p>

                                          <p>You decide how to use the additional fat in your daily
                                          diet. You may want to have foods from the five major food
                                          groups that are higher in fat--such as whole milk instead of
                                          skim milk. Or you may want to use it in cooking or at the
                                          table in the form of spreads, dressings, or toppings.</p>

                                          <p><i>How to check your diet for fat</i></p>

                                          <p></p>

                                          <p>If you want to be sure you have a lowfat diet, you can
                                          count the grams of fat in your day's food choices using the chart below, and compare them to the number of
                                          grams of fat suggested for your calorie
                                          level.
                                          You don't need to count fat grams every day, but doing a fat
                                          checkup once in awhile will help keep you on the right track.
                                          If you find you are eating too much fat, choose lower fat
                                          foods more often.</p>

                                          <p>You can figure the number of grams of fat that provide 30%
                                          of calories in your daily diet as follows:</p>

                                          <p>Multiply your total day's calories by 0.30 to get your
                                          calories from fat per day. Example: 2,200 calories x 0.30 =
                                          660 calories from fat.</p>

                                          <p>Divide calories from fat per day by 9 (each gram of fat
                                          has 9 calories) to get grams of fat per day. Example: 660
                                          calories from fat &divide; 9 = 73 grams of fat.</p>

                                    <p><i>Are some types of fat worse than others?</i></p>


                                          <p><i>Yes.</i> Eating too much saturated fat raises blood
                                          cholesterol levels in many people, increasing their risk for
                                          heart disease. The Dietary Guidelines recommend limiting
                                          saturated fat to less than 10 percent of calories, or about
                                          one-third of total fat intake.</p>

                                          <p>All fats in foods are mixtures of three types of fatty
                                          acids - saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated.</p>

                                          <p><ul>
                                            <li><b>Saturated fats</b> are found in largest amounts in fats from
                                          meat and dairy product and in some vegetables fats such as
                                          coconut, palm, and palm kernel oils. If you are on a 1600-calorie diet, you should have 18 grams or less of saturated fat per day; for a 2200-calorie diet, 24 grams or less of saturated fat per day.</li><li><b>Monounsaturated fats</b> are found mainly in olive, peanut,
                                          and canola oils.</li>
                                          <li><b>Polyunsaturated fats</b> are found mainly in safflower,
                                          sunflower, corn, soybean, and cottonseed oils and some
                                          fish.</li></ul></p>


                                          <p>If you are at a healthy weight and you eat little saturated fat, you'll have leeway to eat some plant foods that are high in unsaturated fats. </p>
                                          <p><i>How do I avoid too much saturated fat?</i></p>

                                          <p>Follow the Food Guide Pyramid, keeping your total fat
                                          within recommended amounts. Choose fat from a
                                          variety of food sources, but mostly from those foods that are
                                          higher in polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat.</p>

                                          <p><i>Selection tips</i>
                                            <ul>
                                            <li>Get most of your calories from plant foods (grains, fruits, vegetables). If you eat foods high in saturated fat for a special occasion, return to foods that are low in saturated fat the next day.</li>
                                            <li>Use lean meats and skim or lowfat dairy products.</li>
                                            <li>Use unsaturated vegetable oils and margarines that list a
                                          liquid vegetable oil as first ingredient on the label. Cut back on solid fats, such as butter, hard margarines, lard, and partially hydrogenated shortenings.</li>
                                          <li>Read nutrition and ingredient labels on food packages to
                                          check the kinds and amounts of fat they contain. Choose foods lower in saturated fat and cholesterol -- low-fat, non-fat, or lean foods.</li>
                                          <li>Limit use of products that contain a large amount of
                                          saturated fats. Examples are nondairy creamers, creamy sauces, fast food, and rich baked
                                          products such as pie crusts and other pastries, cakes, and
                                          cookies.</li>
                                          <li>Trim fat from meats and remove skin from poultry.</li>
                                            <li>Use less fat when cooking.</li>

                                      <p>Cholesterol and fat are not the same thing.</p>

                                            <p></p>

                                            <p>Cholesterol is a fat-like substance present in all animal
                                            foods - meat, poultry, fish, milk and milk products, and egg
                                            yolks. Both the lean and fat of meat and the meat and skin of
                                            poultry contain cholesterol. In milk products, cholesterol is
                                            mostly in the fat -- lower fat products contain less
                                            cholesterol. Egg yolks and organ meats, like liver, are high
                                            in cholesterol. Plant foods do not contain cholesterol.</p>

                                            <p></p>

                                            <p>Dietary cholesterol, as well as saturated fat, raises
                                            blood cholesterol levels in many people, increasing their
                                            risk for heart disease. Some health authorities recommend
                                            that dietary cholesterol be limited to an average of 300 milligrams
                                            or less per day. To keep dietary cholesterol to this level,
                                            follow the Food Guide Pyramid, keeping your total fat to the
                                            amount that's right for you.</p>

                                            <p></p>

                                            <p>It's not necessary to eliminate all foods that are high in
                                            cholesterol. You can have three to four egg yolks a week,
                                            counting those used as ingredients in custards and baked
                                            products. Use lower fat dairy products often and occasionally
                                            include dry beans and peas in place of meat.</p>

                                            <p>Choosing a diet low in fat is a concern for everyone;
                                            choosing one low in sugars is also important for people who
                                            have low calorie needs. Naturally occuring sugars are found in foods such as milk or fruits that also supply many other nutrients. Added sugars include white sugar, brown
                                            sugar, raw sugar, corn syrup, honey, molasses, and many others; these
                                            supply calories and little else nutritionally. Too much sugar can contribute to weight gain and tooth decay, and can decrease the amount of nutritious food you eat overall.</p>

                                            <p>To avoid getting too many calories from sugars, try to
                                            limit your added sugars to 6 teaspoons a day if you eat about
                                            1,600 calories; or 12 teaspoons at 2,200 calories. These amounts are intended to be
                                            averages over time. The patterns are illustrations of
                                            healthful proportions in the diet, not rigid

                                            <p>Added sugars are in foods like candy, soft drinks, baked goods, sweetened drinks, and dairy desserts like ice cream, as

                                            added sugars are also in foods from the food groups, such as
                                            fruit canned in heavy syrup and chocolate milk.</p><p>Drinking eight glasses of water a day can reduce your craving for snacks high in sugar.</p><p>Sugar substitutes such as saccharin, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose are extremely low in calories. Some people find them useful if they want a sweet taste without the calories. Some foods that contain sugar substitutes, however, still have calories. Unless you reduce the total calories you eat or increase your physical activity, using sugar substitutes will not cause you to lose weight.

                                                <p><i>No.</i> But most Americans eat more than they need. Some
                                                health authorities say that sodium intake should not be more
                                                than 2,400 milligrams per day -- about one teaspoon of salt. Nutrition labels also list a Daily Value
                                                (upper limit) of 2,400 milligrams per day of sodium. </p><p>Much of the
                                                sodium in people's diets comes from salt added to foods they buy, or from salt they add while
                                                cooking and at the table. </p>

                                            <p>Alcoholic beverages supply calories but few nutrients. Alcoholic beverages are harmful when consumed in excess, and <b>some people should not drink at all</b>:
                                            <ul><li>Children and adolescents</li>
                                                <li>Individuals of any age who cannot restrict their drinking to moderate levels</li>
                                                <li>Women who may become pregnant or who are pregnant</li>
                                                <li>Individuals who plan to drive, operate machinery, or take part in other activities that require attention, skill, or coordination</li>
                                                <li>Individuals taking prescription or over-the-counter medications that can interact with alcohol</li></ul></p>
                                            <p>Excess alcohol alters judgment and can lead to dependency and a great many other serious health problems. Taking more than one drink per day for women or two drinks per day for men can raise the risk for motor vehicle crashes, other injuries, high blood pressure, stroke, violence, suicide, and certain types of cancer. Even one drink per day can slightly raise the risk of breast cancer. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy increases risk of birth defects. Too much alcohol may cause social and psychological problems, cirrhosis of the liver, inflammation of the pancreas, and damage to the brain and heart. Heavy drinkers also are at risk of malnutrition because alcohol contains calories that may substitute for those in nutritious foods.</p>
                                            <p>If adults choose to drink alcoholic beverages, they should consume them only in moderation  - and with meals to slow alcohol absorption. Moderation is defined as no more than one drink per day for women and no more than two drinks per day for men. This limit is based on differences between the sexes in both weight and metabolism.</p>

                                            <p>Each of the following counts as one drink:
                                            <ul><li>12 ounces of regular beer (150 calories);</li>
                                            <li>5 ounces of wine (100 calories);</li>
                                            <li>1.5 ounces of 80-proof distilled spirits (100 calories).</li></ul></p>
                                          <p><br>NOTE: Even moderate drinking provides extra calories, and a mixer such as a soft drink will add more calories.</p>
                                          <p>Drinking in moderation may lower risk for coronary heart disease, mainly among men over age 45 and women over age 55. However, there are other factors that reduce the risk of heart disease, including a healthy diet, physical activity, avoidance of smoking, and maintenance of a healthy weight.</p>
                                            <p>Moderate consumption provides little, if any, health benefit for younger people. Risk of alcohol abuse increases when drinking starts at an early age.</p>
