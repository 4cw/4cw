    <hr>
      <p>We all like to smile and we all would like to have beautiful smiles. A beautiful smile does not only reflect on our external appearance, it also reflects on our physical well-being. Maintaining a beautiful smile can be simple by taking care of your oral hygiene as you do your physical health.</p>
      <p>Teeth are important tools for survival, and as an added bonus, they enhance our appearance. But like every other part of our bodies, teeth naturally decay. Such decay can be delayed or even prevented with proper dental care.</p>

    <hr>
      <p>We all use our teeth to eat. Regardless of when we eat, the foods we consume cause acids to form. This acid attacks your teeth, which may eventually lead to decay. The more often we eat, the greater number of acid-attacks our teeth have to endure. This acid eventually builds up in the form of plaque.</p>
      <p>Plaque not only causes tooth decay, it also irritates the gums causing them to be more sensitive and prone to bleed more easily. The gums may eventually separate from the teeth and the gaps that are formed may become infected. This infection may then promote decay of the bone around the teeth, which eventually causes tooth loss.</p>
      <p>Gingivitis is another common cause for oral discomfort. Gingivitis is an infection of the gums that causes increased redness and sensitivity. Generally, gingivitis is caused by a lack of good oral care. Personal habits, the types of foods we eat, and routine oral hygiene can all either promote or help prevent the onset and extent of gingivitis. For example, smoking and consuming large amounts of alcohol promotes gum and tooth decay.</p>
      <ul type='square'>
          <li>Bleeding gums is a good indication that you might have gingivitis, in which case, your dentist should examine you.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Another common oral problem is dry mouth. This is usually caused by prescription and over-the-counter medications and if left untreated can cause tooth decay. Saliva is necessary for neutralizing the acids in your mouth and washing away food and plaque. There are ways to restore normal oral conditions, one such method is artificial saliva and oral rinses. Ask your dentist to recommend the best method for you.</p>
      <p>Women have an increased chance to developing gingivitis and other oral health problems due to hormonal changes throughout their lives, especially during puberty, pregnancy, and menopause.</p>
      <p>The best way to prevent such oral health problems is to follow proper daily oral care and have regularly scheduled appointments with your dentist.</p>

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Daily Oral Care</span></b>
    <hr>
    <p>Daily oral care begins with brushing your teeth at least twice a day. Brushing removes plaque build-up from the surface of the teeth and near the gums. Ideally, you should brush your teeth after every meal, to prevent the acids from turning into plaque, but generally brushing in the morning and at night does the trick. Brushing your tongue helps remove bacteria from its surface and promotes fresher breath.</p>
    <p>Flossing is another way to prevent tooth decay on a daily basis. Flossing is geared more towards gum disease prevention by cleaning between the teeth, while massaging, but not cutting into, the gums.</p>

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Overall Nutrition</span></b>
    <hr>
      <p>It is important to understand that our overall nutrition and the way we treat our bodies is reflected in our appearance. Good nutrition leads to healthy, beautiful teeth and a gorgeous smile. So eat right and follow proper daily oral care to make sure you'll enjoy your smile for years to come.</p>
