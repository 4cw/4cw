  <p>The Food Guide Pyramid is a simple, reliable way to plan a nutritious eating pattern. The Pyramid is an outline of what to eat each day. It's not a rigid prescription, but a general guide that lets you choose a healthful diet that's right for you.</p>

  The Pyramid calls for eating a variety of foods to get the nutrients you need and at the same time the right amount of calories to maintain or improve your weight. The Pyramid also focuses on fat because most Americans' diets are too high in fat, especially saturated fat.

  <p>For more information on the Food Pyramid, check out <a href="foodpyramid.html">this page</a>.</p>

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Who is at Risk for Vitamin Deficiency?</span></b>
    <hr>
    <p>Within the category of college women, some people are at risk for vitamin deficiency.</p>
    <b>Women</b> need to get enough calcium and vitamin D to build strong bones and prevent <a href="osteoporosis.html">osteoporosis</a>. Women of childbearing age are at risk for low iron stores because of menstruation.
    <p>Women on  <b>hormonal birth control</b> (like the Pill, the Patch, the Ring, Depo-Provera, and Norplant) may have different amounts of some vitamins and other substances in the blood. For instance, the levels of the B vitamins and vitamin C decrease slightly, and the vitamin A level increases. However, this is not considered to be serious enough to require nutritional supplements. Just remember to eat right. </p>
    <p><b>College students</b> tend to eat too few meals and too much junk food. Many of us can't find enough foods we like in our cafeterias, and we don't always have enough time to exercise.</p>
    <p><b>Teenage girls and women of childbearing age</b> need enough good sources of iron, such as lean meats and cereals with added nutrients, to keep up their iron stores. <b>Adolescent</b> girls and boys are at risk for low iron stores; they traditionally have been prone to anemia because of rapid growth rates, erratic eating habits, and concerns about body image.</p>
    <p><b>Pregnant or lactating women</b> need extra amounts of certain nutrients, such as folic acid, which contributes to fetuses' health. Pregnant women are at risk for low iron stores due to the baby's needs and blood loss during childbirth.</p>
    <p>People who are <b>under stress</b> or <b>sick</b> might not be getting enough nutrients.</p>
    <p><b><a href="vegetarianism.html">Vegetarians and vegans</a></b> need to make sure they are getting enough calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, iron, omega-3 fatty acids, and zinc.</p>
    <p><b>Smokers</b> might need to get extra vitamin C because their bodies' metabolism of the vitamin is higher than nonsmokers'.</p>
    <p><b>Long-distance runners</b> are at risk for low iron stores, because their demanding exertions may somehow damage red blood cells.</p>

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Should I Take Supplements?</span></b>
    <hr>
    <p>Vitamins and minerals are nutrients found naturally in food. <b>The best way to get vitamins and minerals is through the food you eat, not any supplements you might take.</b> Try to eat the number of servings of food recommended by the <a href="foodpyramid.html">Food Guide Pyramid</a> each day. Pick foods that are lower in fat and added sugars. If you can't eat enough, then ask a healthcare professional whether you should be taking a multivitamin/mineral supplement.</p>
    <p>Contact your doctor, your campus health center, your campus dietitian or nutritionist, or the National Center for Nutrition and Dietetics' Consumer Nutrition Hotline (1-800-366-1655). You can also <a href="http://www.eatright.org/cps/rde/xchg/ada/hs.xsl/home_4874_ENU_HTML.htm">search for a dietitian near you</a>.</p>
    <p>To take a quiz to see if you might need a multivitamin/mineral supplement, visit the American Dietetic Association at <a href="http://www.eatright.org/cps/rde/xchg/ada/hs.xsl/nutrition_5455_ENU_HTML.htm">http://www.eatright.org/cps/rde/xchg/ada/hs.xsl/nutrition_5455_ENU_HTML.htm</a>.

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">How Much Does My Body Really Need?</span></b>
    <hr>
    <p>The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) is how much of each
      nutrient most people need in order to be healthy.  RDAs
      are different according to sex and age. The RDAs are determined
      by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of
      Sciences.  The Nutrition Board has been developing a new
      set of nutrient reference values based on current scientific
      knowledge to replace the RDAs with the Dietary
      Reference Intakes (DRIs).  The information provided below is
      based on the most current information available, and has been
      adapted from the NIH Clinical Center (<a href=
      "http://www.cc.nih.gov/ccc/supplements">http://www.cc.nih.gov/ccc/supplements</a>)
      and from the Food and Nutrition Information Center of the FDA
      (<a href=
      "http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/dga/">http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/dga</a>), especially the section on <a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/etext/000105.html">DRIs and RDAs</a>.</p>
    <p>Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) are the highest amount of a vitamin or mineral that you can take while still being moderately safe. All food, water, and supplements that you consume count towards the UL for any particular vitamin or element. On this factsheet, ULs appear either in parentheses after RDAs, or labeled as ULs on the next line.</p>
    <p><b>NOTE: All RDAs and ULs below are for women who are not pregnant or lactating, unless indicated otherwise.</b></p>

      <h3><u>VITAMIN A</u></h3>
      <p>Vitamin A helps in the formation and maintenance of healthy teeth, skeletal and soft tissue, mucous membranes, and skin. It is also known as retinol because it generates the pigments in the retina. Vitamin A promotes good vision, especially in dim light. It may also be required for reproduction and lactation. Beta carotene, which has antioxidant properties, is a precursor to Vitamin A.</p>
      <p>Vitamin A deficiency can increase the susceptibility to infectious diseases, as well as cause vision problems. Large doses of Vitamin A can be toxic. They can also cause abnormal fetal development in pregnant women. Increased amounts of beta-carotene can turn the color of skin to yellow or orange. The skin color returns to normal once the increased intake of beta-carotene is reduced.</p>
      <p>For more information, visit <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002400.htm">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002400.htm</a> and <a href="http://www.cc.nih.gov/ccc/supplements/vita.html">http://www.cc.nih.gov/ccc/supplements/vita.html</a>.</p>
      <p><b>RDA</b>: 14-18 years old: 700 micrograms/day (no more than 2800). 19-30 years old: 700 micrograms/day (no more than 3000).</p>
      <p><h4>Vitamin A Food Sources</h4></p>
      <p>Vitamin A comes from animal sources (such as eggs and meat), and is present in the form of a precursor called beta-carotene, when manufactured by plants.</p>
      <p>Vitamin A is found in milk, cheese, cream, liver, kidney, cod and halibut fish oil. All of these sources, except for skim milk that has been fortified with Vitamin A, are high in saturated fat and cholesterol. The vegetable sources of beta-carotene are fat and cholesterol free.</p>
      <p>The body regulates the conversion of beta-carotene to Vitamin A based on the body's needs. Sources of beta-carotene are carrots, pumpkin, sweet potatoes, winter squashes, cantaloupe, pink grapefruit, apricots, broccoli, spinach, and most dark green, leafy vegetables. The more intense the color of a fruit or vegetable, the higher the beta-carotene content.</p>

    <div id='nutrients__D'>
      <h3><u>VITAMIN D</u></h3>
      <p>Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is used in the absorption of calcium. Vitamin D promotes the body's absorption of calcium, which is essential for the normal development of healthy teeth and bones. It also helps maintain adequate blood levels of the minerals calcium and phosphorus.</p>
      <p>Vitamin D is also known as the "sunshine vitamin" because the body manufactures the vitamin after being exposed to sunshine. It can be obtained through 15-20 minutes of direct sunlight on your skin each day. However, this may be a more risky way of getting vitamin D than through your diet:
        <ul><li>Wearing sunscreen interferes with your body's production of vitamin D, but wearing no sunscreen increases your risk of developing skin cancers.</li>
            <li>Additionally, getting enough vitamin D from 15-20 minutes of sunlight might be impossible for many people due to cold climates, smoggy skies, dark skin, concealment of skin for religious reasons, and sunscreen with an SPF of 8 or greater, all of which may affect the amount of vitamin D produced by sun exposure. All of the people mentioned here would have to expose themselves to the sun for longer than 15-20 minutes without sunscreen to get enough vitamin D.</li>
            <li>Therefore, try to depend on foods, not on sunlight, to get the vitamin D you need.</li>
          </ul></p>
      <p>A vitamin D deficiency leads to soft bones or rickets. Large doses of vitamin D can result in increased calcium absorption from the intestinal tract, and possibly also to increased calcium resorption from the bones, leading to elevated levels of calcium in the blood.  This can lead to abnormal calcium deposition in soft tissues, such as the heart and lungs, reducing their ability to function.</p>
