    <hr>

<p>Osteoporosis is the loss of bone density, causing weak and
fragile bones that fracture and break easily.  Your genes, age, and lifestyle all affect your chances of
developing osteoporosis.
Osteoporosis literally means �porous bones,� and is also known as the silent thief Osteoporosis happens gradually over years, and is not
noticeable until a fracture or break occurs.  Generally, older people, primarily older women, suffer from
osteoporosis. </p>



<p>Women
are 4 times more prone to developing osteoporosis than men.</p>



<p>There are three types of osteoporosis; Senile,
postmenopausal, and secondary.</p>



<p>Senile
Osteoporosis usually results from aging, and affects men and women about
equally.  Age causes a decrease in
bone cell activity, affecting the ability to rebuild bone, resulting in bone
fractures and breaks.</p>

<p>Postmenopausal
Osteoporosis is caused by a decreased level in estrogen.  This type of osteoporosis usually
prevails about ten to fifteen years after the onset of menopause.  Estrogen allows for calcium absorption,
vital for bone growth and maintenance.
A lack of estrogen, therefore, causes less calcium to be absorbed by the
bones than is necessary.  This
causes thinning and weakening of the bones in the form of Osteoporosis.</p>

<p>Secondary
Osteoporosis is caused by other underlying conditions such as cancer,
hypogonadism, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyrodism, gastrectomy, eating
disorders, kidney problems, osteogenesis imperfecta, among others.</p>

    <hr>

<p><b>If older people develop osteoporosis, why should we care about it at such a
young age?</b><hr></p>



<p>Osteoporosis is a treatable, but not curable condition.  Most importantly, osteoporosis can be
prevented or its effects can be delayed with a few simple lifestyle changes
starting at a young age.</p>



<p>Calcium is the most abundant mineral in our bones, providing
for rigidity and growth.  Women
between the ages of 11 to 24 need an increased amount of Calcium a day since
those are the Calcium-storing years.
Most of the body�s bone density is formed before puberty, ending
anywhere between ages 25 to 30, when peak bone density is reached.</p>



<p>Bones constantly undergo a process called remodeling.  In this process, bones are continuously
broken down and rebuilt.  This
process provides for a constant level of calcium in the blood, which is
necessary for muscle contraction, a proper heartbeat, blood circulation, and
blood clotting.  Bone make-up and
this regulation process prove the significance of Calcium in our diets.  After peak bone density is reached, bones
break down much more quickly than they are built up, leading to a decline in
bone density, sometimes resulting in osteoporosis.  The lower the bone density is, the higher the risk of breaks
and fractures that may lead to further complications.</p>



<p>Not everybody reaches an equal peak bone density; it is
genetically determined.  Some of us
have the potential to reach a higher peak bone density than others, but other
factors come into play as well.
Whether followed correctly or incorrectly, the following factors can
either promote or prevent osteoporosis.</p>

<ul>
<li>Diet</li>
<li>Exercise</li>
<li>Healthy
lifestyle and habits</li>
</ul>

<p>The following factors increase a person�s risk for
developing osteoporosis:

<ul>
<li>Smoking</li>
<li>Excessive
alcohol consumption</li>
<li>Excessive
caffeine consumption</li>
<li>Diseases
of the small intestine, liver or pancreas</li>
<li>Early
termination of one�s capacity to menstruate and early menopause</li>
<li>Amenorrhea</li>
<li>Small
body frame</li>
<li>Low
overall body weight</li>
<li>History
of osteoporosis in the family</li>

<li>Chronic
diarrhea</li>

<li>Eating
disorders</li>
<li>Athleticism</li>

<li>High-protein
diets</li>
<li>Fad
diets</li>
<li>Skipping
meals</li>
<li>Lactose
intolerance</li>
<li>Scoliosis</li>
<li>Inactivity</li>
<li>Inadequate
nutrition</li>
<li>Excessive
exercise</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The underlying theme in the above-mentioned risk factors is
Calcium absorption and loss of Calcium through urinations or defecation.  All of the conditions either prevent
Calcium absorption or promote Calcium loss.  Both cause the body to depend on the Calcium from the bones
to maintain proper levels in the blood.</p>

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">Prevention</span></b>
    <hr>

<p>Now that we understand the significance of Calcium in our
bodies, and how easily Calcium is lost from our bodies, we need to understand
how to prevent such loss and maintain what we already have.</p>



<p>The most obvious way to prevent osteoporosis is to increase
Calcium intake.  Calcium is contained
in high amounts in dairy products, fish, soybeans, tofu, and dark green
vegetables as well as in Calcium supplements.  An increase in Calcium intake leads to a higher bone
density.  Women between the ages of
11 and 24 need at least 1,200 mg of Calcium a day, while other premenopausal
women need about 1,000 mg.
(Careful, too much Calcium can cause kidney stones).</p>



<p>Another way to increase bone density is exercise.  Weight-bearing exercises put stress on
the bones, allowing for mass buildup.
Such exercises include:

<ul>
<li>Carrying
and/or lifting weights</li>

<li>Running</li>

<li>Jumping</li>

<li>Aerobic
exercise</li>

<li>Walking</li>

<li>Swimming</li>

<li>Sports</li>

<li>Bicycling</li>

<li>Dancing</li>

<li>Hiking</li>

<li>Skiing</li>

<li>Household
chores</li>
</ul></p>


<p>Bones also need Vitamin D for Calcium absorption from the
intestine to the bloodstream and into the bone.  Simple sun exposure provides for necessary Vitamin D levels
in the body.  Vitamin D can also be
integrated into one�s diet, along with other necessary vitamins for a healthy
lifestyle.</p>



<p>Leading a healthy lifestyle with low alcohol and caffeine
consumption also helps prevent osteoporosis.  Not smoking and eating balanced diets without skipping meals
also play a significant role in osteoporosis prevention.</p>



<p>Leading healthy lifestyles and developing proper habits at a
young age, helps prevent complications later in life.  Osteoporosis is easily preventable (or delayed) by
integrating the simple steps mentioned above into your lifestyle.  Treat your body right and it will treat
you right in return.</p>
