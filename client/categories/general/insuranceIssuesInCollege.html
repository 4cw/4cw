              <p class="section">Despite the importance of health insurance at all stages
               of life, it is often on aspect of college life that students
               do not take into consideration.</p>
               <p>Many states have requirements that make all college
               students have health insurance. The Massachusetts Universal
               Health Care Act, for example, requires all college students
               in three-quarter (nine credits per semester) to full-time
               enrollment to participate in a qualifying health insurance
               program.</p>     

               <p>Students typically have two choices when it comes to choosing
               a health insurance plan: their family plan or one through
               their college.</p>     

               <p>Here are some things to consider when purchasing insurance
               through your schools:</p>    

               <ul type="disc">
                 <li>Is the plan an HMO, or can I use any health
                 provider?</li>     

                 <li>What services are offered free or low-cost in the
                 campus health center?</li>     

                 <li>Is the campus health center open 24 hours? How is it
                 staffed?</li>    

                 <li>Are emergency room visits covered in all situations or
                 only in specific situations?</li>    

                 <li>Does the plan cover me when I am on vacation (i.e.
                 spring break)?</li>    

                 <li>Does the plan cover me during the summer if I'm not
                 taking any classes?</li>     

                 <li>Are hospitals in the college area accessible and
                 utilized?</li>     

                 <li>Does the plan include mental health treatment?</li>    

                 <li>What preexisting conditions are excluded?</li>
               </ul>

               <p>A factor to consider when deciding to stay with your
                family's health insurance plan is how long you can remain
                insured.&nbsp; Some will allow any full-time students to
                remain on their parents' plan until they graduate; some
                provide a post-graduation grace period, while others require
                you to pay more once you move out of state. The only way to
                know for sure what your plan stipulates is to contact your
                provider.</p>     

               <p>Besides Health Insurance, there are other types of
                insurance that college students and recent college graduates
                will need to consider.</p>

                <p>Renters insurance is a form of a homeowners policy that
                protects your belongings from problems like fire and theft.
                For instance, if your new suitemate drops your stereo or her
                friend just happens to take it home with her, to another
                country, your landlord's insurance will not cover the
                cost to replace it. This is where renters' insurance comes
                in.</p>     

                <p>Renters insurance is similar to car insurance in that it
                covers, up to a certain amount depending on your policy, your
                liability for damages that you or members of your family
                (including that pesky kitten you love so much) may
                inadvertently cause to other people.&nbsp;</p>      

                <p>There are two types of renters insurance: replacement
                value and actual cash value.</p>      

                <ul type="disc">
                  <li><u>Replacement value</u> replaces the damaged item with
                  another one of the same kind according to current
                  prices.</li>      

                  <li><u>Actual cash value</u> is replacement cost minus
                  depreciation, which means you will get less money than it
                  will cost to replace the item.</li>
                </ul>     

                <p>When purchasing renters insurance, be sure you find out
                about coverage limits for items like computers, televisions
                and jewelry as you may need additional coverage for more
                expensive valuables.</p>      

                <p>When you move into a new apartment, especially if it is
                with people you don't know well, it is a good idea to
                take an inventory of everything you own in the apartment. One
                way to do this is to take pictures to document specific items
                and models. Don't keep the pictures in your apartment,
                though. Give them to your parents to store, or put them in a
                safety deposit box at the bank. Should something happen to
                your belongings you will be glad you have proof of what was
                lost or damaged.</p>

                <p>Many college students decide to buy their first cars
                during or immediately after college. One thing many new-car
                buyers do not consider is the high cost of insurance. It is
                important to calculate this added monthly cost to the amount
                you will pay for the car, as it can become a real financial
                burden.</p>       

                <p>REMEMBER -- If you can't afford the insurance, you
                can't afford the car.</p>       

                <p>Here are a few suggestions for reducing the cost of your
                car insurance policy:
                <ul>
                  <li>Consider purchasing a low-profile car. If no thief in his
                  right mind would want to steal your junker, your policy will
                  be significantly lower. (No one needs to know about what's
                  under the hood, in this business it's looks that matter
                  most.)</li>
                  <li>Raise your deductible.</li>
                  <li>Install anti-theft devices.</li>
                  <li>Drop collision coverage if it's an older car.</li>
                </ul></p>       

                <p>Also, as with any expensive purchase, prices may vary from
                insurance company to insurance company so it may pay to shop
                around.</p>

              <div class="tab-pane" id="tab_insurance_4">
                <div class="box">
                <p>Ask around. Your friends, co-workers, boss, parents, or
                relatives may have great suggestions for inexpensive but
                effective insurance plans. Almost everyone changes providers
                at one point or another so asking these kinds of questions
                may provide you with a breadth knowledge that you would not
                find elsewhere.</p>     

                <p>Contact your state insurance department for information
                about agents and companies in your area. Many state insurance
                departments also have cost comparison surveys that will make
                the legwork easier.</p>
