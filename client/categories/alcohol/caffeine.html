Coffee, soda, tea and even chocolate are all filled with caffeine, a substance that many of us rely on to get through busy days at college.  People have enjoyed foods and beverages containing caffeine for thousands of years.  It is one of the most well-studied ingredients in the food supply; even so, controversy and misperceptions about this food component continue.

<div id="caffeine__health"><hr><b>Caffeine and Health</b><hr>
During the past two decades, extensive research has been conducted on the health aspects of caffeine consumption.
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified caffeine as "Generally Recognized As Safe" (GRAS) in 1958. A more recent review "found no evidence to show that the use of caffeine in carbonated beverages would render these products injurious to health." </p>
<p>The American Medical Association (AMA) has a similar position on caffeine's safety, stating that:
"Moderate tea or coffee drinkers probably need have no concern for their health relative to their caffeine consumption provided other lifestyle habits (diet, alcohol consumption) are moderate, as well."</p>
<br><i>The American Medical Association</i>
<p>
Most experts agree that moderation and common sense are the keys for consuming caffeine-containing foods and beverages. Moderate caffeine consumption is considered to be about 300 mg. or the equivalent of 3 cups of coffee per day, but this depends on the individual and can vary from one to several beverages. Consumers with certain health problems may wish to consult with their physician or health care provider about caffeine consumption.</p>

<div id="caffeine__you"><hr><b>Caffeine and You</b><hr>
People differ greatly in their sensitivity to caffeine.  While some can down cup after cup without any visible effects, others may be feeling "wired" after just a cup or two.  Results of caffeine consumption may include increased alertness in tired individuals and enhanced performance of certain tasks.
Many people find caffeinated beverages can help them stay alert when they work or study.
However, caffeine may cause sleeplessness and interfere with performance in school.
<a href="http://www.healthfinder.gov/news/newsstory.asp?docid=511139">(more info)</a>
<p>
National Institutes of Health (NIH) research indicates there is no difference in the way children and adults handle caffeine. These studies have shown that caffeine-containing foods and beverages do not have an effect on hyperactivity or the attention span of children.
</p>
</div>
<div id="caffeine__addiction">
<b>Addiction and Dependence</b><br>
Though we tend to use the term "addiction" loosely, someone who consumes high levels of caffeine each day may become physically dependent upon caffeine. While the World Health Organization claims that there is no evidence to support caffeine as having the potential to produce consequences that we associate with serious drug abuse, some people do experience symptoms of dependence.  These include: headache, restlessness and irritability when their daily intake is altered. Any discomfort you feel from stopping consumption of caffeine can be avoided by progressively decreasing intake over a few days.

<div id="caffeine__pregnancy">
<b>Pregnancy</b><br>
Studies in humans have shown that caffeine may cause miscarriage or may slow the growth of a developing fetus when given in doses greater than 300 mg (an amount equal to three cups of coffee) a day. In addition, use of large amounts of caffeine by the mother during pregnancy may cause problems with the heart rhythm of the fetus. Therefore, it is recommended that pregnant women consume less than 300 mg of caffeine a day.<sup><a href="caffeine___ftn2">[2]</a></sup>
<p>
Some studies suggest that high levels of caffeine intake may delay time to conception, but these findings are inconclusive and often inconsistent when other lifestyle variables are considered. Research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Harvard Medical School and the University of California at Berkeley show that moderate caffeine consumption does not reduce a woman's chance of becoming pregnant.<sup><a href="caffeine___ftn3">[3]</a></sup>

<div id="caffeine__cancer">
<b>Cancer</b><br>
A 1986 study of 16,600 individuals published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found no relationship between coffee consumption and cancer risk. The most recent review by the International Agency for Research on Cancer also concluded that data do not support a link between caffeine consumption and cancer in humans.
<p>
Several other large-scale studies have been conducted to determine whether there is an association between coffee intake and cancer risk. Most of them have not found an increased incidence of cancer among people who drink coffee.

<div id="caffeine__breast">
<b>Breast Disease</b><br>
There has not been any strong relationship found between caffeine intake and the development of breast disease.
</div>

<div id="caffeine__osteo">
<b>Osteoporosis</b><br>
Research has shown that caffeine intake is not a significant risk factor for osteoporosis, particularly in women who consume adequate calcium. Therefore, the best way to avoid <span class=smalldict>OSTEOPOROSIS</span> is to ensure that you eat foods with plenty of calcium.

</div>

<div id="caffeine__cardio">
<b>Cardiovascular Disease</b><br>
So far there is little evidence to support the link between caffeine and heart problems.  Scientists have generally found that moderate caffeine consumption does not lead to long-term heart problems.
<p>
Caffeine does not cause chronic high blood pressure or any persistent increase in blood pressure. Some individuals may experience a rise in blood pressure, usually not lasting more than several hours. Studies show that any rise in blood pressure is modest and less than that normally experienced when climbing stairs.<sup><a href="caffeine___ftn1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p>
However, individuals with high blood pressure should consult their physician about caffeine intake.</p>
