<p>
At one time or another, most college students have been around someone that was mixing substances, whether it's tobacco and alcohol; prescription drugs and marijuana or club drugs (such as ecstasy).  It is important to know the risks you or someone you care about is taking when they mix substances. Many medications can interact with alcohol, leading to increased risk of illness, injury, or death. For example, it is estimated that alcohol-medication interactions may be a factor in at least 25 percent of all emergency room admissions <a href="mixing___ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=

<P>
The bottom line is that mixing substances can be lethal <a href="mixing___ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=

<ul>
<li>  The first word on the prescription is the name of the drug, next is the dosage form (liquid, capsules, tablets) and the strength (such as 250 mg, or milligrams). After that is the amount you will get (15 capsules, 5 fluid ounces), followed by the directions for use. These are often abbreviations of Latin words. If you have any questions, the pharmacist will translate this information on the label of the medicine container. </li>
<li>  The prescription form will also indicate how many times the prescription can be refilled. It's a good idea to check the prescription before you leave the doctor's office; if there is anything you don't understand, ask about it. </li>
<li>  Detailed information for patients does not have to accompany most prescription drugs. But for a few the Food and Drug Administration does require a leaflet or brochure that tells about the benefits and risks of these products. If there is such a brochure with a drug prescribed for you, be sure to read it carefully and if you have questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </li>

    <hr>
<p>
Two or more drugs, taken at the same time, can interact and affect the way one or the other behaves in the body. For example, an antacid will cause a blood-thinning (anti-coagulant) drug to be absorbed too slowly, while aspirin greatly increases the blood-thinning effect of such drugs. Two drugs with the same effect when taken together can sometimes have an impact greater than would be expected. This is called potentiation. </p>
<p>
Potentiation can be helpful, as when the antibiotic trimethoprim is used to boost the effect of another antibiotic, sulfamethoxazole, in combating certain infections.
</p><p>
Potentiation also can be dangerous, particularly when several central nervous system depressing drugs are involved.
</p><p>
Even non-prescription drugs, such as antihistamines that are often used to fight colds, can increase the sedative effects of anesthetics, barbiturates, tranquilizers and some pain-killers. It is important that when you are taking more than one medication that you check with a medical doctor or pharmacist to make sure the two do not interact negatively <a href="mixing___ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=

Food can interact with drugs, making them work faster or slower or even preventing them from working at all. Please be sure to check with your doctor or pharmacist to make sure that you know what you can and cannot eat with your medication. Here are some examples, but be sure to talk with a doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any medication.

<li>Calcium in dairy products impairs absorption of tetracycline, a widely used antibiotic. </li>
<li>Citrus fruits or juices containing ascorbic acid speeds the absorption of iron from iron supplements. </li>
<li>Soft drinks, and fruit and vegetable juices with high acid contents (such as grape, apple, orange or tomato) cause some drugs to dissolve in the stomach instead of the intestines where they can be more readily absorbed.</li>
<li>Oral contraceptives are known to lower blood levels of folic acid and vitamin B6, women who take birth control pills would be wise to include dark green leafy vegetables in their diet. </li>

    <hr>
<p>
Women on birth control pills who smoke have an increased risk of heart attack, stroke and other circulatory diseases. Nicotine and other tobacco products speed up the metabolism of theophylline, an asthma drug, and pentazocine, a pain-killer, and to a lesser extent certain tranquilizers, analgesics, and anti-depressants. Thus, smokers may need larger than normal doses of these drugs. When they stop smoking, dosage of these drugs may have to be changed. Smoking also can affect certain diagnostic tests, such as red and white blood cell counts and blood clotting time determinations.

<p>Quick Facts
<ul>
<li>More than 2,800 prescription drugs are available in the United States</li>
<li>Physicians write 14 billion prescriptions annually</li>
<li>Approximately 2,000 medications are available without prescription</li>
<li>Approximately 70 percent of the adult population consumes alcohol at least occasionally, and 10 percent drink daily. </li>
<li>About 60 percent of men and 30 percent of women have had one or more adverse alcohol related life events. </li>
</ul></p>
<p>
Together with the data on medication use, these statistics suggest that some concurrent use of alcohol and medications is inevitable in many people7.</p>
<p>
Individuals who drink alcoholic beverages should be aware that simultaneous use of alcohol and medications -- both prescribed and over-the-counter -- has the potential to cause problems. For example, even very small doses of alcohol probably should not be used with antihistamines and other medications with sedative effects. Individuals who drink larger amounts of alcohol may run into problems when commonly used medications (e.g., acetaminophen) are taken at the same time (or even shortly after drinking) <a href="mixing___ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=

    <b><span style="font-size:12pt">How Alcohol and Drugs Interact</span></b>
    <hr>
<p>
To exert its desired effect, a drug generally must travel through the bloodstream to its site of action, where it produces some change in an organ or tissue. The drug's effects then diminish as it is processed (metabolized) by enzymes and eliminated from the body. Alcohol behaves similarly, traveling through the bloodstream, acting upon the brain to cause intoxication, and finally being metabolized and eliminated principally by the liver. The extent to which an administered dose of a drug reaches its site of action is termed its "availability". Alcohol can influence the effectiveness of a drug by altering its availability. <a href="mixing___ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=
    ""><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
 <p>

Typical alcohol-drug interactions include the following:

<ul>
<li>An acute dose of alcohol (a single drink or several drinks over several hours) may inhibit a drug's metabolism by competing with the drug for the same set of metabolizing enzymes. This interaction prolongs and enhances the drug's availability, potentially increasing the patient's risk of experiencing harmful side effects from the drug. </li>
<li>In contrast, chronic (long term) alcohol ingestion may activate drug metabolizing enzymes, thus decreasing the drug's availability and diminishing its effects. After these enzymes have been activated, they remain activated even in the absence of alcohol, affecting the metabolism of certain drugs for several weeks after cessation of drinking. Thus, a recently abstinent chronic drinker may need higher doses of medications than those required by nondrinkers to achieve therapeutic levels of certain drugs. </li>
<li>Enzymes activated by chronic alcohol consumption transform some drugs into toxic chemicals that can damage the liver or other organs. </li>
<li>Alcohol can magnify the inhibitory effects of sedatives and narcotic drugs at their sites of action in the brain. To add to the complexity of these interactions, some drugs affect the metabolism of alcohol, thus altering its potential for intoxication and increasing the adverse effects associated with alcohol consumption. <a href="mixing___ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=
    ""><sup>[1]</sup></a></li>
</ul></p>
<p>
If a doctor prescribes a medication, or you are taking an over-the-counter medication, it is important to check with a medical professional about the possible interactions of your medication with alcohol, and both legal and illegal drugs. Here is a list of a few medications and their affects with alcohol.

In combination with acute alcohol consumption, some antibiotics may cause nausea, vomiting, headache, and possibly convulsions; among these antibiotics are furazolidone (Furoxone), griseofulvin (Grisactin and others), metronidazole (Flagyl), and the antimalarial quinacrine (Atabrine). Isoniazid and rifampin are used together to treat tuberculosis. Acute alcohol consumption decreases the availability of isoniazid in the bloodstream, whereas chronic alcohol use decreases the availability of rifampin.

The significance of these interactions is unclear. These chronic effects persist in recovering alcoholics. A chemical called tyramine, found in some beers and wine, interacts with some anti-depressants, such as <span class=smalldict>MONOAMINE OXIDASE</span> inhibitors, to produce a dangerous rise in blood pressure.

Because of their greater safety margin, they have largely replaced the barbiturates, now used mostly in the emergency treatment of convulsions. Doses of benzodiazepines that are excessively sedating may cause severe drowsiness in the presence of alcohol, increasing the risk of household and automotive accidents. Low doses of flurazepam (Dalmane) interact with low doses of alcohol to impair driving ability, even when alcohol is ingested the morning after taking Dalmane. The benzodiazepine lorazepam (Ativan) is being increasingly used for its antianxiety and sedative effects. The combination of alcohol and lorazepam may result in depressed heart and breathing functions; therefore, lorazepam should not be administered to intoxicated patients. Acute alcohol consumption increases the availability of barbiturates, prolonging their sedative effect. Chronic alcohol consumption decreases <span class=smalldict>BARBITURATE</span> availability through enzyme activation.

<p>
Warm weather and a cold beer - it's a combination that many college students might find appealing, but we are unaware of many potential health risks involved with alcohol and the sun. Mixing alcohol and the sun dehydrates your body and can lead to heat exhaustion. The symptoms of heat exhaustion include a body temperature of 104 degrees, vomiting, dizziness and even passing out, and the skin can become flushed and damp. </p>
<p>
If gone untreated, heat exhaustion can progress into heat stroke, a serious condition and a medical emergency in which the patient should go to the hospital immediately. The symptoms of heat stroke include a body temperature of 105 degrees, and hot, dry skin. In 80 percent of all heat stroke cases, the patient experiences a sudden rise in temperature, which can lead to a coma and/or hallucinations. </p>
<p>
Drinking alcohol outdoors can be safe if students take precautions. Drinking plenty of water and non-carbonated, decaffeinated beverages before and while drinking alcohol or going out in the sun may counterbalance the effects of dehydration and heat exhaustion <a href="mixing___ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=
